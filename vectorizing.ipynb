The government has certain rights in the invention. \\n FIELD OF THE INVENTION \\n The present invention relates to a method for computer aided analysis of images, and more specifically to a method \\n for localizing features within an image. \\n BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n Over the last decade, new applications in computer vision and computational photography have arisen due to earlier \\n advances in methods for detecting human faces in images. \\n These applications include face detection-based autofocus \\n and white balancing in cameras, Smile and blink detection, new methods for sorting and retrieving images in digital \\n photo management Software, obscuration of facial identity in digital photos, facial expression recognition, virtual try-on, \\n product recommendations, facial performance capture, ava \\n tars, controls, image editing software tailored for faces, and systems for automatic face recognition and verification. The first step of any face processing system is the detection \\n of locations in the images where faces are present. However, face detection from a single image is challenging because of \\n variability in Scale, location, orientation, and pose. Facial expression, occlusion, and lighting conditions also change \\n the overall appearance of faces. \\n Given an arbitrary image, the goal of face detection is to \\n determine whether or not there are any faces in the image and, \\n if present, return the image location and extent of each face. \\n The challenges associated with face detection can be attrib uted to the following factors: \\n Pose: The images of a face vary due to the relative camera face pose (frontal, 45 degree, profile, upside-down), and some \\n facial features such as an eye or the nose may become par tially or wholly occluded. \\n Presence or absence of structural components: Facial fea tures such as beards, moustaches, and glasses may or may not be present, and there is a great deal of variability among these components including shape, color, and size. \\n Facial expression: The appearance of faces is directly \\n affected by a person’s facial expression. \\n Occlusion: Faces may be partially occluded by other objects. In an image with a group of people, some faces may \\n partially occlude other faces. Image orientation: Face images vary directly for different \\n rotations about the camera's optical axis. Imaging conditions: When the image is formed, factors Such as lighting (spectra, Source distribution and intensity) \\n and camera characteristics (sensor response, lenses, filters) affect the appearance of a face. 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 2 \\n Camera Settings: The settings on the camera and the way \\n that is used can affect the image focus blur, motion blur, depth \\n of field, compression (e.g., jpeg) artifacts, and image noise. \\n Face detectors usually return the image location of a rect angular bounding box containing a face—this serves as the \\n starting point for processing the image. A part of the process \\n that is currently in need of improvement is the accurate detec \\n tion and localization of parts of the face, e.g., eyebrow cor \\n ners, eye corners, tip of the nose, earlobes, hair part, jawline, \\n mouth corners, chin, etc. These parts are often referred to as facial feature points or “fiducial points'. Unlike general inter\", metadata={'source': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/95/38/bcc3b288e56669/US9275273.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content=\"ners, eye corners, tip of the nose, earlobes, hair part, jawline, \\n mouth corners, chin, etc. These parts are often referred to as facial feature points or “fiducial points'. Unlike general inter \\n est or corner points, the fiducial point locations may not correspond to image locations with high gradients (e.g., tip of \\n the nose). As a result, their detection may require larger image \\n Support. \\n A number of approaches have been reported which have demonstrated great accuracy in localizing parts in mostly \\n frontal images, and often in controlled settings. \\n Early work on facial feature detection was often described as a component of a larger face processing task. For example, \\n Burl, et al. take a bottom-up approach to face detection, first \\n detecting candidate facial features over the whole image, then \\n selecting the most face-like constellation using a statistical \\n model of the distances between pairs of features. Other works detect large-scale facial parts such as each eye, the nose, and \\n the mouth and return a contour or bounding box around these components. \\n There is a long history of part-based object descriptions in \\n computer vision and perceptual psychology. Recent \\n approaches have shown a renewed emphasis on parts-based \\n descriptions and attributes because one can learn descriptions of individual parts and then compose them, generalizing to an \\n exponential number of combinations. The Poselets work by Bourdev and Malik, incorporated herein by reference, \\n describes a data-driven search for object parts that may be a \\n useful approach for addressing some of the described inad equacies of the prior art in order to achieve precise face \\n detection in uncontrolled image conditions. Many fiducial point detectors include classifiers that are trained to respond to a specific fiducial (e.g., left corner of the \\n left eye). These classifiers take as input raw pixel intensities \\n over a window or the output of a bank of filters (Gaussian \\n Derivative filters, Gabor filters, or Haar-like features). These local detectors are scanned over a portion of the image and \\n may return one or more candidate locations for the part or a \\n “score” at each location. This local detector is often a binary \\n classifier (feature or not-feature). For example, the Viola Jones style detector, which uses an image representation \\n called an “integral image' rather than working directly with \\n image intensities, has been applied to facial features. False \\n detections occur often, even for well-trained classifiers, because portions of the image have the appearance of a fidu \\n cial under some imaging condition. For example, a common \\n erroris for a “left corner of left eye' detector to respond to the \\n left corner of the right eye. Eckhart, et al. achieve robustness and handle greater pose variation by using a large area of \\n Support for the detector covering, e.g., an entire eye or the \\n nose with room to spare. Searching over a smaller region that \\n includes the actual part location reduces the chance of false detections with minimal impact of missing fiducials. While \\n this may be somewhat effective for frontal fiducial point \\n detection, the location of a part within the face detector box can vary significantly when the head rotates in three-dimen sions. For example, while the left eye is in the upper-left side \\n of the box when frontal, it can move to the right side when the face is seen in profile.\", metadata={'source': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/95/38/bcc3b288e56669/US9275273.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='US 9,275,273 B2 \\n 3 \\n To better handle larger variations in pose, constraints can \\n be established about the relative location of parts with respect \\n to each other rather than the actual location of each part to the detector box. This can be expressed as predicted locations, bounding regions, or as a conditional probability distribution \\n of one part location given another location. Alternatively, the \\n joint probability distribution of all the parts can be used, and \\n one model is that they form a multivariate normal distribution whose mean is the average location of each part. This is the model underlying Active Appearance Models and Active \\n Shape Models, which have been used for facial feature point detection in near frontal images. Saragih, et al. extend this to \\n use a Gaussian Mixture Model, whereas Everingham, et al. handle a wider range of pose, lighting and expression varia \\n tions by modeling the joint probability of the location of nine \\n fiducials relative to the bounding box with a mixture of Gaus sian trees. As pointed out in this work, a joint distribution of \\n part locations over a wide range of poses cannot be adequately modeled by a single Gaussian. \\n While a number of approaches balance local feature detec tor responses on the image with prior global information about the feature configurations, optimizing the resulting \\n objective function remains a challenge. The locations of some parts vary significantly with expression (e.g., the mouth, eye \\n brows) whereas others. Such as the eye corners and nose, are more stable. Consequently, Some detection methods organize \\n their search to first identify the stable points. The location of the mouth points are then constrained, possibly through a \\n conditional probability, by the locations of stable points. \\n However, this approach fails when these stable points cannot be reliably detected, for example, when the eyes are hidden by Sunglasses. \\n The need for the ability to reliably detect and identify \\n features within an image is not limited to human facial rec ognition. Many other disciplines rely on specific features \\n within an image to facilitate identification of an object within an image. For example, conservation organizations utilize \\n markings such as ear notches, Scars, tail patterns, etc., on wild \\n animals for identification of individual animals for study of migration patterns, behavior and survival. The ability to reli \\n ably locate and identify the unique features within an image \\n of an animal could provide expanded data for use in Such studies. Other applications of image analysis that could ben \\n efit from improved feature location capability include identi \\n fication of vehicles within images for military or law enforce \\n ment applications, and identification of structures in satellite images, to name a few. \\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n According to the present invention, a method is provided \\n for facial feature detection by combining the outputs of a \\n plurality of local detectors with a consensus of non-paramet \\n ric global models for part locations. \\n The inventive method for face detection begins with a large collection of pre-specified (labeled) parts in images of human \\n faces taken under a variety of acquisition conditions, includ ing variability in pose, lighting, expression, hairstyle, Subject \\n age, Subject ethnicity, partial-occlusion of the face, camera \\n type, image compression, resolution, and focus. This collec tion captures both the variability of appearance of each part \\n and the variability in the relative positions of each part. \\n The collection of labeled exemplar images is used as a \\n training set for a local detector, which evaluates Small win \\n dows in the image to determine whether the area within the window contains the desired part. Using scale-invariant fea \\n tures within the image, the local detector, which is a sliding 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 4', metadata={'source': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/95/38/bcc3b288e56669/US9275273.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='tures within the image, the local detector, which is a sliding 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 4 \\n window classifier, generates a detector score for each point in \\n the image, with the score corresponding to the likelihood that \\n the desired part is located at a given point in the image. The \\n sliding window classifier may be a neural network, Support \\n vector machine (SVM), Viola-Jones-style detector, or other learning machine that is appropriate for image analysis appli \\n cations. The sliding window classifier may be applied over the expected range of image locations for the particular part. \\n Next, a global detector is developed for a collection offiducial \\n points by combining the outputs of the local detectors with a \\n non-parametric prior model of face shape. By assuming that \\n global model images generate the part locations as hidden \\n variables, a Bayesian objective function can be derived. This \\n function is optimized using a consensus of models for the \\n hidden variables to determine the most likely values of the \\n hidden variables from which the part location can be deter \\n mined. \\n In a Bayesian sense, a generative probabilistic model \\n P(W) for the i-th fiducial can be constructed this is the probability distribution of the image feature W from the marked fiducials in the collection. Letting X={x\\', x, ... x\"} denote the locations of the n fiducials, the prior probability \\n distribution of the fiducial location PCX) can be estimated from the fiducial locations in the image collection. Detection of the parts in an input image can use the probabilistic models \\n on the appearance P(W) and fiducial locations POX) to find the fiducial locations in an input image by maximizing a Bayesian objective function. Alternatively, image features \\n that are not at the locations of the fiducials (negative \\n examples) and the features at the locations of fiducials (posi \\n tive examples used to construct P(W)) can be used to con struct classifiers or regressors for each fiducial. These classi fier outputs can be combined using the prior model on fiducial location POX) to detect fiducials in an input image. Existing \\n methods for detecting parts in faces that create a prior model \\n on the configuration of fiducials have used parametric forms \\n for PCX) such as a multivariate normal distribution or a mix \\n ture of Gaussian, whereas the inventive method uses a non parametric form that is dictated by the training collection. \\n In one aspect of the invention, the facial feature localiza tion method is formulated as a Bayesian inference that com \\n bines the output of local detectors with a prior model of face shape. The prior on the configuration of face parts is non \\n parametric, making use of a large collection of diverse, \\n labeled exemplars. Hidden (latent) variables are introduced for the identity and parts locations within the exemplar to \\n generate fiducial locations in a new image.

Although the examples described herein relate to detecting parts of a human face, the inventive method may be used for detecting parts within images of many other \\n classes of objects, e.g., animals (dogs, cats, wild animals, \\n marine mammals, etc.) or animal faces, parts of bicycles, \\n vehicles, or structures. Thus, the described examples of face part detection are not intended to be limiting. \\n FIG.1 provides the basic steps of the inventive method 100. In step 101, a large number of image exemplars are collected, \\n preferably without constraint as to pose, expression, occlu \\n sion or other characteristics that would make the detection \\n process easier. In step 102, the image exemplars are marked \\n by hand with fiducial points. Examples of these fiducial \\n points are shown in FIG. 2, overlaid on an image obtained \\n from the Internet. In addition to the marked fiducials, a virtual fiducial location in each training image can be defined as a \\n mathematical function of a subset of the marked fiducial. For \\n example, a virtual fiducial in the center of the chin could be created by taking the average location of a fiducial located on \\n the lower lip and a fiducial located on the chin. In step 103, the marked image exemplars are downloaded \\n into a database that can be accessed by a processor that is programmed to execute a learning machine. The following steps are part of a computer program that \\n may be embodied within a non-transitory computer-readable \\n medium for causing a computer processor to execute the \\n specified steps. (For purposes of the present invention, a “computer processor includes a Supercomputing grid or \\n cluster, a network server, a private or dedicated server, a standard personal computer or laptop, a tablet computer, a \\n Smartphone, video game console or controller, digital cam \\n era, or any other known computing device (stand-alone or \\n embedded within another electronic device) that is capable of processing images.) In step 104, an optional pre-processing', metadata={'source': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/95/38/bcc3b288e56669/US9275273.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='US 9,275,273 B2 \\n 7 \\n or feature selection step, an algorithm is applied to select the \\n features that are most determinative of the patterns to be \\n recognized. In one example, known feature selection algo \\n rithms such as the well-known AdaBoost may be used to improve the performance of the Subsequent classifiers. In \\n another example, techniques for image feature detection and \\n characterization, e.g., Hough transforms, edge detection, \\n blob detection, histograms of Gradients (HOG), Speeded Up \\n Robust Feature (SURF), and others, may be applied. As \\n described below, in the preferred embodiment, a scale-invari \\n ant feature transform (SIFT) is used. \\n In step 105 local detectors are trained using the training \\n images selected from the set of image exemplars and features \\n extracted from the image. In the preferred embodiment, the \\n classifier is a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) with \\n a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The local detectors return a score indicating the likelihood of an image location \\n being a particular fiducial point. The local detector is scanned \\n overan image and a score at each image location is computed; \\n a high score is a more likely location in the image for the \\n feature. The image locations that are local maxima of the detector output are referred to as “detector peaks.” \\n In step 106, data for an image to be evaluated is input into \\n the processor, and, in step 107, the trained local detectors are used to generate detector scores for each fiducial point type for each point in the image. Although not shown, the input image may require some pre-processing if the input image is \\n more that just a face. In this case, a face detector may be applied to the image to identify a region of the image that \\n contains a face, and this region would be the input to Subse quent steps. For example, in a group photograph, or in a \\n photograph where the Subject is Surrounded by structures or other background, a rectangle of an input image can be \\n cropped out and used as the input for face part detection. The \\n inventive method takes as input an image that contains a face. This optional face detector step can be bypassed when it is known that input contains only a single face at an approxi \\n mately known or specified location, orientation, and size (e.g., head shots in a yearbook). \\n In step 108, a plurality of non-parametric global models is generated using the image exemplars. (Note that step 108 can \\n follow either step 102 or step 103.) In step 109, the global \\n models from step 108 and the detector scores from step 107 are combined. A Bayesian objective function is derived by \\n assuming that the global models generate locations of the \\n parts as hidden variables. This function is optimized using a \\n consensus of global models for the hidden variables. The models that provide the best fit to the data are selected in step \\n 110. In step 111, the selected set of best fitting models is used to label the part locations in the image that was input in step 106. An output is generated in step 112, where the image 113 \\n may be stored in memory for further processing and/or dis played via agraphic display or printoutata user interface with \\n the part locations (fiducial points) labeled, as shown in FIG.2. \\n Note that the dots shown in the image are used to indicate that the parts were correctly found and accurately located. \\n In optional step 114, the labeled output image 113 can be further processed using the same or a different processor \\n programmed with facial recognition Software to identify the \\n individual whose face parts have been labeled by the inven \\n tive method. For Such processing, the marked locations will \\n be characterized as coordinates within the image, which will then be stored as an output. A face recognition system will use \\n the coordinates corresponding to the fiducial locations along with the input image for performing the recognition proce \\n dure. 5 \\n 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40', metadata={'source': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/95/38/bcc3b288e56669/US9275273.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content=\"the coordinates corresponding to the fiducial locations along with the input image for performing the recognition proce \\n dure. 5 \\n 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 8 \\n For purposes of this description, “facial features”, “face \\n parts”, “facial landmarks' and “parts' may be used inter \\n changeably to refer to a feature of a face. “Fiducial points' \\n refers to the location within an image, commonly seen as a \\n grid or array of pixels, at which the facial features, landmarks or parts may be found. \\n The dataset used for training and testing the inventive method was a collection of face images acquired from inter net search sites using simple text queries. More than a thou sand images were hand-labeled to create the dataset, which is referred to as “Labeled Face Parts in the Wild', or “LFPWA commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) face detector was used to detect faces within the collected images. (No intentional fil tering was applied to exclude poor quality images.) Unlike datasets that are acquired systematically in laboratories, there were few preconditions in the LFPW dataset that would tend to make detection easier. Rather, images were included where the eyes might be occluded by glasses, Sunglasses, or hair; there may be heavy shadowing across features; the facial expression may be arbitrary; the face may have no makeup or be made up theatrically; the image may actually be an artistic rendering; the pose may be varied; there may be facial hair that occludes the fiducial points; and part of the face may be occluded by a hat, wall, cigarette, hand, or microphone. For example, FIGS. 3 and 6 illustrate a number of these condi tions. As a result, this dataset stands in contrast to datasets such as FERET or BioID which have been used for evaluating fiducial point detection in that the images are not restricted to frontal faces or collected in a controlled manner, e.g., using the same camera for all images. The inventive method consists of two basic processes. Given an input image containing a face, local detectors gen \\n erate detector scores for points in the image, where the score \\n provides an indication of the likelihood that a desired part is \\n located at a given point within the image. The detector scores \\n generated by the local detectors are then combined with a non-parametric prior model of a face shape. \\n For each local detector, a sliding window detector is scanned over a region of the image. The sliding window detectors may be a learning machine Such as a neural net work, linear or nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) or other learning machine. In a preferred embodiment, the detectors are SVM regressors with grayscale SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors as features. The SIFT descriptor window may be computed at two scales: \\n roughly /4 and /2 the inter-ocular distance. These two SIFT descriptors are then concatenated to form a single 256 dimen sional feature vector for the SVM regressor. In another embodiment, color SIFT is used to capture color variation of face parts. It will be recognized by practitioners with ordinary \\n skill in the art that there are other feature descriptors besides SIFT that could be used including histograms of gradients (HOG), color histograms, SURF ORB, Binary Robust Inde pendent Elementary Features (BRIEF), etc. It will also be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that other regressors that are trained with positive and negative training examples and take a feature descriptor as input and return a \\n score can be used. \\n For all of the training samples, the images were rescaled so \\n that the faces have an inter-ocular distance of roughly 55 pixels. Positive samples are taken at the manually annotated \\n part locations. Negative samples are taken at least 4 of the \\n inter-ocular distance away from the annotated locations. In addition, random image plane rotations within t20 are used to synthesize additional training samples.\", metadata={'source': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/95/38/bcc3b288e56669/US9275273.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='inter-ocular distance away from the annotated locations. In addition, random image plane rotations within t20 are used to synthesize additional training samples. \\n These local detectors return a score at each point X in the image (or in some Smaller region of the face as inferred from \\n an earlier face detection step).

Once normalized, this score is written as P(xd), i.e., \\n the probability that the fiducial is at location X given all the \\n scores in the detection window. \\n As the local detectors are imperfect, the correct location \\n will not always be at the location with the highest detector \\n score. This can happen for many of the aforementioned rea \\n Sons, including occlusions due to head pose and visual \\n obstructions such as hair, glasses, hands, microphones, etc. \\n These mistakes in the local detector almost always happen at \\n places that are inconsistent with positions of the other, cor \\n rectly detected fiducial points. Nonetheless, the global detec \\n tors can be built to better handle the cases where the local \\n detectors are likely to go astray. \\n Although faces come in different shapes, present them \\n selves to the camera in many ways, and may possess extreme facial expressions, there are strong anatomical and geometric \\n constraints that govern the layout of face parts and their \\n location in images. These constraints are not modeled explic itly, but rather the training data dictates this implicitly. All the part locations are taken together to develop a global detector \\n for a collection offiducial points. A global model encodes the configuration of part locations. More formally, let X={x\\', x, ... x\"} denote the locations of n parts, where x\\' is the location of the i\\' part.

This value is then normalized to behave like a probability by dividing by \\n the sum of d\\'(x) for all x in the detector window. Computing the sum and integral in Eq. 10 is challenging, as \\n they are taken over all global models k and all similarity \\n transformations t. However, as noted from Eq. 2, if P(XID) is very small for a given k and t, it will be unlikely to contrib \\n ute much to the overall sum and integration. Thus, the strategy \\n is to consider only those global models k with transforma tions t for which P(XID) is large. In a sense, one performs a Monte Carlo integration of Eq. \\n 10 where the global models X chosen are those that are likely to contribute to the sum and integral. In the following, \\n the process is described for selecting a list of k and t that are used to compute this integration. \\n The goal is to optimize PCXID) over the unknownsk and t. This optimization is non-linear, and not amenable to gradi \\n ent descent-type algorithms. First, k is a discrete variable with \\n a large number of possible values. Second, even for a fixed k, different values oft can be expected to produce large numbers of local optima because the fiducial detectors usually produce \\n a multi-modal output. Transformations that align a model \\n with any subsets of these modes are likely to produce local optima in the optimization function. \\n To address this issue, a generate-and-test approach similar \\n to RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) can be used by generating a large number of plausible values for the hidden \\n variables k and t. Each of these values is evaluated using Eq. \\n 9, keeping track of them best global models, i.e., them best pairs k and t. This is done in the following steps: \\n 1. Select a random k. \\n 2. Select two random parts. Randomly match each model part to one of the ghighest peaks of the detector output \\n (i.e., highest detector scores) for that part. \\n 3.

Thus, the method could be applied to find face parts of \\n non-humans such as cats, dogs and other animals, as well as parts of inanimate objects, as well as for identification of distinct features within Some other image. For example, indi vidual humpback whales are identified by color patterns, \\n notches and Scars on their tails, so a parts locator could assist in computer-aided identification of a whale within an image \\n where angle, rotation and other variables may make it difficult to locate the body parts, especially given the short periods of \\n time during which the whales are visible Rhinoceros in the \\n wild are identified by features such as ear notches, horn characteristics, and tail length and curvature, so the ability to automatically locate these body parts within a photograph of \\n these shy animals would be helpful for conservation studies. \\n In another example, the inventive method may be used to find parts of a bicycle Such as the front hub, rear hub, peddles, seat, \\n left handlebar, right handlebar, crank arms, and brake levers.

The inventive method can be applied to find parts of many other objects of interest for use in various computer vision applications. \\n EXAMPLES \\n The present invention focuses on localizing parts in natural face images, taken under a wide range of poses, lighting \\n conditions, and facial expressions, in the presence of occlud ing objects such as Sunglasses or microphones.

Faces were excluded only if they were \\n incorrectly detected by the COTS detector or if they con \\n tained text on the face. Note also that the COTS face detector \\n does not detect faces in or near profile, and so these images are implicitly excluded from the dataset. To obtain ground truth data, thirty-five fiducial points on \\n each face were labeled by workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace that \\n enables computer programmers to coordinate the use of human intelligence to perform tasks that computers are cur \\n rently unable to do.

There is a degree of Subjectivity in the way humans \\n label the location of fiducial points in the images, and this is \\n seen in FIG.4, which shows the variation amongst the MTurk \\n workers. Some parts like the eye corners are more consis \\n tently labeled whereas the brows and chin are labeled less accurately. \\n The publicly available BioID dataset contains 1,521 images, each showing a frontal view of a face of one of 23 \\n different subjects. Seventeen fiducial points that had been \\n marked for the FGNet project were used, and the me, error \\n measure as defined by Cristinacce and Cootes was used to compare detected locations from ground truth locations. This \\n dataset has been widely used, allowing the results to be benchmarked with prior work. Note that training was per \\n formed using the LFPW dataset, and while testing was done \\n using the BioID data. There are considerable differences in the viewing conditions of these two datasets. Furthermore, \\n the locations of parts in LFPW do not always match those of BioID, and so a fixed offset was computed between parts that were defined differently. For example, where the left and right \\n nose points are outside of the nose in LFPW, they are below the nose in BioID). FIG. 7 shows some sample images, along \\n with the results obtain using the inventive method. The LFPW dataset was randomly split into 1,100 training \\n images and 300 test images. (An additional 1,600 images 10 \\n 15 \\n 25 \\n 30 \\n 35 \\n 40 \\n 45 \\n 50 \\n 55 \\n 60 \\n 65 14 \\n were held out for subsequent evaluations at future dates.) Training images were used to train the SVM-based fiducial detectors and served as the exemplars for computing the \\n global models X. \\n The results of each localization were evaluated by measur ing the distance from each localized part to the average of \\n three locations supplied by MTurk workers. Error is mea \\n Sured as a fraction of the inter-ocular distance, to normalize for image size. FIG. 4 shows the resulting error broken down by part. This figure also compares the error in the inventive \\n method to the average distance between points marked by one MTurk worker and the average of the points marked by the \\n other two. As shown, this distance almost always exceeds the distance from points localized by the inventive approach to \\n the average of the points marked by humans. It is worth noting \\n that the eye points (9-18) are the most accurate, the nose and mouth points (19-29) are slightly worse, and the chin and eye \\n brows (1-8, 29) are least accurate. This trend is consistent between human and automatic labeling. FIGS. 3 and 6 show results on some representative images. \\n To highlight a few characteristics of these results, these images include non-frontal images including viewpoints \\n from below (FIG.3: Row 1, Col. 2 and FIG. 6: Row 2, Col. 2), difficult lighting (FIG. 6: Row 4, Col. 1), glasses (FIG. 6: Row', metadata={'source': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/95/38/bcc3b288e56669/US9275273.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='from below (FIG.3: Row 1, Col. 2 and FIG. 6: Row 2, Col. 2), difficult lighting (FIG. 6: Row 4, Col. 1), glasses (FIG. 6: Row \\n 1, Col. 5), sunglasses (FIG. 6: Row 2, Col. 4 and FIG. 6: Row 4, Col. 3), partial occlusion (FIG. 6: Row 2, Col. 5 by a pipe \\n and FIG. 6: Row 3, Col. 4 by hair), an artist drawing (FIG. 6: \\n Row 1, Col. 3), theatrical makeup (FIG. 6: Row 2, Col. 1), etc. \\n The localizer requires less than one second per fiducial on an \\n INTEL(R) Core i7 3.06 GHz machine; most of the time is spent evaluating the local detectors. \\n FIG.5 provides a comparison of the LFPW results from the \\n inventive method against those of the detector of Everingham \\n et al. At roughly 3% mean error rate, the results for the \\n inventive method are roughly twice as accurate as those of the prior art detector. \\n FIG. 6 shows a few examples of errors in the inventive \\n system. In Row 1, Cols. 2 and 5, local cues for the chin are \\n indistinct, and the chin is not localized exactly. Row 2, Col. 4 shows an example in which the lower lip is incorrectly local \\n ized. This can happen when the mouth is open and a row of \\n teeth are visible. It is believed that these errors can be prima \\n rily attributed to the local detectors and should be overcome by employing color-based representations that can more eas \\n ily distinguish between lips and teeth. In Row 4, Col. 1, the \\n left corner of the left eyebrow is too low, presumably due to \\n occlusion from the hair. \\n FIG. 7 illustrates results from the application of the inven \\n tive part localizer to the BioID faces. Results have been reported on this dataset by a number of authors. FIG. 8 shows \\n the cumulative error distribution of the me, error measure (mean error of 17 fiducials) defined by Cristinacce and Cootes, and compares the results of the inventive method to those reported by Cristinacce and Cootes, Milborrow and \\n Nicolls, Valstaret al., and Vukadinovic and Pantic. The results \\n of the inventive part localizer are similar to, but slightly better \\n than, those of Valstar et al., who have reported the best current \\n results on this dataset. It should be noted that training of the inventive system occurred using a very different dataset \\n (LFPW), and that locations of some fiducials were defined a bit differently. \\n FIG.9 shows the cumulative error distribution of the me, error measure for the inventive method applied to LFPW. Even though LFPW is a more challenging dataset, the cumu \\n lative error distribution curve on LFPW is almost identical to \\n the cumulative error distribution curve on BioID. (Note that the two figures have different scales along the x-axis.) FIG.9', metadata={'source': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/95/38/bcc3b288e56669/US9275273.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='US 9,275,273 B2 \\n 15 \\n also shows the cumulative error distribution when only the \\n local detectors are used and when locations are predicted \\n solely from the face box. While the local detectors are effec tive for most fiducial points, there is a clear benefit from using the consensus of global models. Many of the occluded fidu cial points are incorrectly located by the local detectors, as \\n evidenced by the slow climb toward 1.0 of the local detectors \\n CUV. \\n The inventive method provides a new approach to localiz ing parts in face images. The method utilizes a Bayesian \\n model that combines local detector outputs with a consensus of non-parametric global models for part locations, computed \\n from exemplars. The inventive parts localizer is accurate over a large range of real-world variations in pose, expression, lighting, makeup, and image quality, providing a significant \\n improvement over the limitations of existing approaches. \\n REFERENCES \\n 1. 1st Intl.
