A non-parametric global model of the locations of the fiducial points is gener ated for each of at least a portion of the image exemplars. An input image is analyzed using the trained local detectors, and a Bayesian objective function is derived for the input image from the non-parametric model and detector scores. The Bayesian objective function is optimized using a consensus of global models, and an output is generated with locations of the fiducial points labeled within the object in the image. \n",

Other aspects relate to imaging architectures , in which a mobile phone's image sensor is one in a chain of stages that successively act on packetized instructions / data , to capture and later process imagery . Still other aspects relate to distribution of processing tasks between the mobile device and remote resources ( “ the cloud ” ) . Elemental image pro cessing ( e.g. , simple filtering and edge detection ) can be performed on the mobile phone , while other operations can be referred out to remote service providers . The remote service providers can be selected using techniques such as reverse auctions , through which they compete for processing tasks .
