       "  'description': 'TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to brewed beverage appliances and, more particularly, to a brewed beverage appliance adapted to brew coffee from a pre-packaged, disposable container and filter combination.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONVarious known coffee making appliances involve adding of coffee beans in one of various forms (i.e., ground or unground) to a container that is part of a machine in which heated water is delivered to the container and passes therethrough. The container typically includes a filtering mechanism so that heated water exiting the container is in the form of brewed coffee. Certain appliances require pre-ground coffee beans to be added in the form of \"grounds.\" Other appliances are designed to accept whole coffee beans into a hopper or opening and include mechanisms that grind the beans into a ground form and then complete the brewing process at a separate station. It is sometimes preferred to keep whole beans on hand for making coffee so that the coffee may be ground immediately prior to brewing, as this is believed to produce the freshest tasting coffee beverage. Yet other appliances required use of pods or pre-packaged coffee grounds in a serving-sized filter container to be inserted into the appliance. In such instances, the pre-packaged pods or containers are limited to being filled with ground coffee. Certain pre-packaged containers require placement into a separate filter mechanism in the appliance, while others have built-in filtering mechanisms. DocumentWO 2007/016977 A1discloses a device for extracting an extraction product, e.g. coffee, which is contained in a capsule, comprising a capsule holder that can be pivoted between a receiving position and an ejection position. DocumentEP 0041082 A1discloses an apparatus which includes a rotating blade and heatable basket and a method for making coffee according to which roasting, grinding and infusing of the coffee take place in the same heatable container.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the present invention to provide a beverage making appliance and related method that include the benefits of brewing coffee from whole beans that are ground immediately before brewing and that are contained in a convenient, disposable, single-serving package.These and other objects are achieved by the present invention.A beverage appliance includes a housing having a liquid reservoir and a receptacle in the housing dimensioned to receive a container containing at least one drink ingredient having particles of a first size. The receptacle is pivotable from a first position in which the receptacle is angled towards a front of the appliance and a second position in which the receptacle is aligned with a brew head and contacts the brew head. The beverage further includes a mechanism for transforming the particles of the drink ingredient from the first size to a second size within the container, the second size being smaller than the first size.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1is an exploded view of a whole coffee bean pre-packaged filter cup according to the present invention.FIG. 2is a perspective top view of the whole coffee

beverage appliance according to the present invention includes acup body12, aresilient filter14 and acover16. The cup body may be formed from plastic or other material known in the art, and is capable of being pierced by a piercing mechanism of a brewed beverage appliance. Thefilter14 prevents coffee grounds and/or other sediment from exiting thecup body12 during brewing but permits passage of liquid therethrough. Importantly, thefilter14 is resilient such that it is not damaged or destroyed during grinding, as discussed in detail hereinafter. Thecover16 may be formed from aluminum or other material known in the art, and is preferably heat-sealed or otherwise affixed to the top rim of thecup body12. A plurality ofwhole coffee beans18 are enclosed in the space between thecover16 and thefilter14. WhileFIG. 1showscoffee beans18 housed in thefilter cup10, other types of food and substances, such as tea and the like, may be used in similar fashion to that described herein, without departing from the broader aspects of the present invention.As further shown inFIG. 1, thecup body12 has anopening20 at the top thereof, acircumferential sidewall22 and afloor24. As best shown inFIGS. 3 and 6, thefloor24 has anannular groove26 for the channeling of a brewed beverage to an exit aperture of the cup (created by a piercing mechanism of a brewed beverage appliance). Importantly, theannular groove26 is the lowest portion of thecup10 such that brewed coffee collects in thegroove26 and exits the cup through the exit aperture, as discussed hereinafter.FIG. 7illustrates thecup10 in a sealed state and containing a plurality ofwhole coffee beans18. As shown therein, theresilient filter14 is positioned at the bottom of thecup10, just above theannular groove26. Thefilter14 is circular and sized to be closely received by thecircumferential sidewall22 of the cup body at the bottom thereof. As best shown inFIG. 7, thefilter14 provides a flat surface in thecup body12 on top of whichcoffee bean18 may rest. Importantly, theresilient filter14 prevents thecoffee beans18 from falling into the annular groove 26 (which is out of reach of a grinding blade) to facilitate optimal grinding by the grinding blade, as discussed in detail hereinafter. As discussed above, the foil cover 16 seals thefilter14 andwhole coffee beans18 inside thecup body12, keeping thecoffee beans18 fresh until use.As will be readily appreciated, theprepackaged filter cup10 is completely sealed on all sides thereof so as to ensure freshness of thecoffee beans18 or other beverage ingredients within thecup10. In an embodiment, thecup10 may be vacuum-sealed to further ensure freshness of the beverage ingredients. In another embodiment, hecup10 may be stored and transported in a separate sealed package or wrapper for additional freshness and protection. In the preferred embodiment, thefilter cup10 is a pre-packaged, single-use, disposable component. Thus, it is sealed by thecover16 in an air-tight manner to preserve freshness and flavor and to protect thecoffee beans18 from moisture and contamination.As shown inFIG. 8, and as discussed in detail hereinafter, the floor of theannular groove26 may be pierced by a needle of a brewed beverage appliance. A blade of the beverage appliance pierces thecover16 such that water may enter thecup body12. The water is then passed through thecup10 to create brewed coffee, which exist the cup through the aperture created by the needle.Referring toFIGS. 9-25B, a brewedbeverage appliance100 according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. Theappliance100 is intended to be used in combination with theprepackaged filter cup10, disclosed above, in order to brew coffee or other beverage. As shown therein, theappliance100 is generally rectangular in shape and includes abase102 and adrip tray104 removably received by thebase102. Thedrip tray104 has a slotted or gratedtop surface106 that is adapted to support a container, such as a coffee cup. As will be readily appreciated, thegrated surface106 permits liquid that may be spilled from thecup108 during operation to pass through thesurface106 and collect in thedrip tray104, for easy cleanup.Ahousing110 is located above and is supported by thebase102. In an embodiment, thehousing110 may be integrally formed with thebase102. The housing includes a slidingaccess door112 that allows access to a filter cup container holder orloading tray124 for securing and positioning aprepackaged filter cup10. A lockinghandle114 is pivotally mounted to thehousing110 for operation, as described below. As further shown inFIGS. 9 and 10, awater reservoir116 is attached to, supported by, and otherwise forms a part of thehousing110. In an embodiment, thewater reservoir116 may be removably or permanently affixed to thehousing110. Thehousing110 also includes acontrol panel118 for controlling operation of theappliance100, as discussed hereinafter. As best shown inFIG. 10, thebase102 also includes adrain tray120 slidably received therein for receiving water from a cleaning operation of theappliance100.With further reference toFIGS. 9-25B, theappliance100 includes abrew spout122 from which a brewed beverage is dispensed. In an embodiment, thebrew spout122 is adjustable in height, as discussed hereinafter.Operation of theappliance100 will now be described with specific reference toFIGS. 17-25B. First, thewater reservoir116 is filled with water. A user then selects the desired coffee/beverage settings from thecontrol panel118. Settings may include selectable options such as coffee strength and serving size, timer setting, automatic brew, etc. Thehandle114 is then moved upwardly in the direction of arrowA, as shown inFIG. 17, which causes the slidingaccess door112 to move downward in the direction of arrow B to expose theloading tray124. When thehandle114 is in the \"up\" position and the slidingaccess door112 is retracted, theloading tray124 is pivoted and angled toward the front of theappliance100 so as to allow a user to easily insert aprepackaged filter cup10, as shown inFIG. 18. A user may then place acoffee cup108 on thedrip tray104, directly beneath thebrew spout122.Once aprepackaged filter cup10 is positioned in theloading tray124, as shown inFIG. 19, the lockinghandle114 is then moved downward in the direction of arrow C, as shown inFIG. 20. As shown therein, this causes slidingaccess door112 to move upwards in the direction of arrowD,to block access to the interior components of theappliance100, and also moves thefilter cup10 into a grind and brew position, as discussed hereinafter.A user then selects the desired brew settings using thebuttons126 on theLCD control panel118, and presses a \"BREW\" button to initiate the grinding and brewing processes. During the grinding process, thecoffee beans20 in thefilter cup10 are ground by a grindingblade assembly128 that is received within thecup10 so that thebeans20 are transformed intocoffee grounds130. After thewhole coffee beans18 within thecup10 are transformed intocoffee grounds130, the brewing process will automatically commence. During the brewing process, heated water is delivered into thecup10 from a brew orshower head132. The heated water passes through thecoffee grounds130, exits through the bottom of the filter cup 10 (seeFIG. 8), and is emitted from thebrew spout122 into thecoffee mug108 positioned on thetray104. Thecoffee mug108 may then be removed from thetray104 and is ready to enjoy.To remove a usedfilter cup10, the lockinghandle114 is once again moved into the \"up\" position, as represented by arrowEinFIG. 23, which causes theloading tray124 to retract from the grind/brew position and rotate outwardly towards a user, and also causes theaccess door112 to open. A user then manually removes thespend filter cup10 and disposes of the same.With reference toFIGS. 25A and 25B, once thefilter cup10 is discarded, a user can again move the locking handle 114 to its downward position to close theaccess door114. Importantly, theappliance100 contains control circuitry, which will automatically initiate a cleaning process when the handle is moved to the downward position subsequent to brewing. During the cleaning process, water is dispensed from the brew/shower head132 to rinse remaining coffee grounds from the grindingblade assembly128 and the internal brewing area. This water is then collected in thedrain tray120 which can be emptied, as necessary, by sliding it out from the base 102 in the direction of arrow F, as shown inFIG. 25B. In an embodiment, theblade assembly128 may rotate during application of water to facilitate cleaning. At this point, theappliance100 is in a standby mode and is ready to brew another beverage.In yet another embodiment, a cleaning operation may include running a brewing cycle without actually inserting afilter cup10. In this embodiment, thehandle114 may be moved downward to begin the cycle such that heated water is passed over theblade assembly128 to clean the same. Alternatively, a button on thecontrol panel118 may be depressed to initiate the cleaning cycle.FIGS. 26 and 27illustrate certain internal components of theappliance100. With reference toFIG. 26, theappliance100 includes agrinder motor134 having a rotating output shaft that drives the grindingblade assembly128. Theappliance100 also includes aheater136 of the type known in the art that functions to heat water from thewater reservoir116 for use in the brewing process, apump138 that draws water from thereservoir116 via theheater136 and pumps the water to theshower head132 for infusion into thefilter cup10, and aflow meter140 which measures the flow of water from thetank116. Theflow meter140 may be of the type known in the art and is electrically coupled to the printedcircuit board196 of thecontrol panel118. In this manner, signals representing the flow rate of water from thetank116 are relayed to thecontrol panel118 so that the correct amount of brewed coffee is dispensed from thespout122 into a user\\'scoffee mug108.As further shown inFIG. 26, awater inlet142 connects to thewater tank116 and provides a passage from thetank116 to awater conduit144. Asafety valve146 is provided which functions to release internal pressure when it reaches a predetermined point. Apressure release valve148 is also provided. As shown inFIGS. 26 and 27, theappliance100 also includes a three-way valve151 andsolenoid152. The three-way valve151 is triggered by thesolenoid152 to control the flow path from the coffee outlet at theloading tray124 to either thespout122 or thedrain tray120.FIG. 26also shows acontainer loading block154 which houses theloading tray124, as discussed hereinafter.Turning now toFIGS. 28 and 29, detail views of thecontainer loading block154 are shown. Thecontainer loading block154 includes thecontainer loading tray124 defining a generally cylindrical recess adapted to received aprepackaged filter cup10. A pin or needle (not shown inFIGS. 28 and 29) is provided adjacent the bottom of the cylindrical recess to pierce the bottom of afilter cup10. Aseal ring156 is configured adjacent the top rim of the cylindrical recess which provides an air-tight and water-tight seal between theloading tray124 and brew /shower head132 during brewing, as discussed hereinafter. As best shown inFIG. 29, thecontainer loading block154 further includes a supporting hinge set 158 which allows for vertical and rotational movement of theloading tray124, allows theloading tray124 to be moved into registration with the brew head, and which engages the slidingaccess door112 to provide movement thereof upon movement of thehandle114 between its up and down positions. Ahandle shaft160 extends outwards from a lower portion of the hinge set 158 and is adapted to receive a complimentary mating portion of thehandle114 in fixed relation. As will be readily appreciated, rotation of thelocking handle114, and thus handleshaft160, controls movement (upwards, downwards and pivoting movement) of theloading tray124. Acoffee outlet162 is also provided on thecontainer loading block154. Thecoffee outlet162 is in fluid communication with the pin that pierces thefilter cup10 and directs brewed coffee / water to the three-way valve151, and ultimately to either the drain tray 120 (during a cleaning/rinsing mode) or to thespout122 for dispensing (during a brewing mode).Turning now toFIGS. 32 and 33, the piercing mechanism for piercing a hole in the bottom of thefilter cup10 is shown. As best shown inFIG. 32, the piercing mechanism is in the form of ahollow pin164 or needle built in at the bottom of theloading tray24. The bottom of theloading tray124 includes anannular recess166 dimensioned to receive theannular groove26 of a filter cup. The hollow interior of thepin164 is in fluid communication with thecoffee outlet162 so a to provide a flow path from the interior of thefilter cup10 to thespout122, as discussed hereinafter. As shown inFIGS. 32 and 33, when afilter cup10 is inserted into theloading tray124, thepin164 pierces thefloor24 of thefilter cup10 and enters theannular groove26. Importantly, the filter cup design, including the annular groove, the loading tray design, including theannular recess166, and pin length are such that thepin164 will not pierce thefilter cup10 very deeply in order to avoid piercing theresilient filter14. During brewing, however, the internal pressure within thefilter cup10 will build up and cause theannular groove26 of the filter cup to expand downward, causing thepin164 to reach an optimum piercing depth within thefilter cup10, whereby an aperture in the needle is exposed to the interior of thefilter cup10 so that brewed coffee may flow from thefilter cup10, through thepin164 and to thecoffee outlet162. As discussed above, thecoffee outlet162 is in fluid communication with the three-way valve151 so that coffee/liquid can be selectively directed to either the coffee spout 122 (in a brewing mode) or the drain tray 120 (in a cleaning / rinsing mode).FIGS. 34-36illustrate acontainer loading mechanism168 which is housed within thecontainer loading block154. Thecontainer loading mechanism168 is comprised of theloading tray124 and hinge set 158, handleshaft160 and handle 114. When thelocking handle114 is rotated downwardly, theloading tray124 rotates inward in the direction of arrow G, as shown inFIG. 34, until the top of theloading tray124 is in line with the brew /shower head132, as shown inFIG. 34. Upon further downward rotation of thelocking handle114, theloading tray124 translates upward, in the direction of arrow H, towards the brew /shower head132 and theblade assembly128 until theblade assembly128 pierces thecover16 of thefilter cup10. As thehandle114 is moved to its fully downward position, theseal ring156 is pressed against the underside of the brew /shower head132, thereby creating an air and liquid tight seal. Brewing may then be commenced.FIGS. 37 and 38illustrate acontainer unloading mechanism170. As shown therein, themechanism170 includes a plurality ofpush rods172 that extend through the brew /shower head132 and are positioned so as to contact the rim of the filter cup 10 (or theseal ring156 when nofilter cup10 is present) when theloading tray124 is in the brew position. Each of thepush rods172 is fitted with acoil spring174, or the like, and arod seal ring176. In the preferred embodiment there are three push rods, although less than or more than three may be utilized without departing from the broader aspects of the present invention.When theloading tray124 and filtercup10 are pushed up against theshower head132 during loading, thefilter cup10 causes the springbiased push rods172 to retract. In this position, thepush rods172 exert a downward force on thefilter cup10 due to the bias of the coil springs 174.FIG. 39shows the position of thepush rods172 in the loaded/brew position (before thefilter cup10 is unloaded). Subsequent to brewing, when thehandle114 is moved downward, theloading tray124 retracts from theshower head132 and the bias of thepush rods172 pushes against the rim of the usedfilter cup10 to ensure that thefilter cup10 retracts from theshower head132 with the loading tray 124 (without the bias force of thepush rods172, it is possible that thefilter cup10 may stick to the shower head 132).FIG. 40illustrates the position of thepush rods172 during unloading of thefilter cup10.In an embodiment, one of thepush rods172 may be configured with asensor178 electrically coupled to thePCB196 of thecontrol panel118. Thesensor178 is configured to detect whether or not afilter cup10 is present and to relay feedback signals to thecontrol panel118 regarding the same. In particular, thesensor178 is configured to detect a distance of movement of one of thepush rods172 when theloading tray124 is moved into the brew position. Depending on the distance of movement, thesensor178 can detect whether or not afilter cup10 is present. This is then relayed to thePCB196.Various views of thegrinding blade128 for grinding the whole coffee beans are shown inFIGS. 41-46. As shown therein, theblade128 has a V-shaped configuration. Importantly, theblade128 hasinsert cutting edges180 so that thecover16 of afilter cup10 can be pierced when thecup10 is raised into registration with theshower head132 upon downwards movement of thehandle114. The top of the blade also includes upward facingextract cutting edges182 for cutting through thecover16 when thefilter cup10 is lowered away from theblade128 subsequent to brewing, upon upwards movement of thehandle114. Each leg of the \"V\" is also formed with anopposed recess184 and raisedridge186 to facilitate grinding of thecoffee beans18, as described hereinafter. Theblade128 also includes aflat neck188 for connection to the output shaft of the grindingmotor134. In such an embodiment, theblade128 may be removable for replacement and/or more thorough cleaning. In an alternative embodiment, theblade128 is integrally formed or otherwise fixedly secured to the output shaft of themotor134. As will be readily appreciated, the slim profile of theblade128 puts cuts a slot a minimal width in thecover16 to preventcoffee grounds130 from being thrown out of thecup10 during grinding.FIG. 47is an enlarged, detail view illustrating afilter cup10 being raised toward theblade128 andFIG. 48illustrates theblade128, by way of theinsert cutting edges180, piercing thecover16 of thecup10. In bothFIGS. 47 and 48thecoffee beans18 in thecup10 are not yet ground. After grinding, thebeans18 have been transformed intoground coffee130. Brewing occurs, as described above, and thecup10 is then lowered as shown inFIGS. 49 and 50such that theextract cutting edges182 of theblade128 again pierce thecover16, if necessary, to facilitate removal of thecup10 from theblade128.Referring now toFIGS. 51-53, the actual grinding process is illustrated. Upon actuation of the grindingmotor134, the grindingblade128 rotates at a frequency sufficient to grind thewhole coffee beans18 in thefilter cup10 to transform thecoffee beans18 from whole beans, as shown inFIG. 51, into grinds 130, as shown inFIG. 53. In particular, theblade128 is rotated in a direction (seeFIG. 52) that causes theridge186 on theblade166 to strike / impact thecoffee beans18, as shown inFIG. 54, to cause them to split. Over time, numerous impacts from the blade itself, and most importantly, by theridges186, as shown inFIG. 54, gradually reduce the size of the coffee beans to fine grounds sufficient for brewing.In an embodiment, theblade128 may continue to rotate at a predetermined frequency during the brewing process, i.e., during the time during which hot water is passed through thecup10. The frequency of rotation during brewing may be the same as, or different from, the frequency utilized to grind thecoffee beans18. In other embodiments, theblade128 may be utilized to stir drink ingredients during brewing, such as to facilitate dissolution of drink ingredients into the water passing through the cup 10 (e.g., when utilizing iced tea drink ingredients in place of whole coffee beans). As will be readily appreciated, stirring the drink ingredients/coffee beans within thecup10 while brewing may produce a better tasting beverage. In particular, stirring during brewing may improve the contact between thecoffee grounds130 and the hot water, which may improve coffee quality and / or concentration.Turning now toFIG. 55, operation of the brewing mechanism is illustrated. As shown therein, water from thewater tank116 is heated by theheater136 and pumped by thepump138 to the shower/brew head132. Thebrew head132 includes a plurality ofsmall apertures190 through which the heated water passes before entering thefilter cup10 through the hole created by the grindingblade128. Notably, thenumerous apertures190 deliver water evenly to the top of thefilter cup10, which helps to minimize the amount ofcoffee grounds130 at the brew head and keeps thecover16 clean after the brewing process. The heated water fills up thefilter cup10. When thefilter cup10 is full with heated water, pressure is built up within the container (as a thefilter14 limits flow). As a result, pressurized brewing occurs within thefilter cup10. In an embodiment, as discussed above, theblade128 may rotate during brewing to facilitate contact between the heated water and thecoffee grounds130, thereby improving coffee qualify. The brewed coffee then passes through thefilter14 into theannular groove26 of thecup10, and through thehollow needle164 to thecoffee outlet162. From thecoffee outlet162, the brewed coffee passes through the three-way valve151 and to thecoffee spout122 for dispensing into acoffee cup108.In an embodiment, near the end of the brewing cycle, thepump138 will stop first so that theheater136 further heats up the water to produce stem. This steam travels through the system to push the remaining coffee out of thefilter cup10. As will be readily appreciated, this stem burst removes excess water from thecoffee grounds130 within thefilter cup10, thereby ensuring an easy and mess-free disposal and cleanup.FIGS. 56-58illustrate an auto-rinsing mechanism which is automatically initiated once brewing is completed. Once afilter cup10 is removed by the user after the brewing process,coffee grounds130 may remain on thegrinding blade128 or thebrew head132, as shown inFIG. 56. When a user pulls down on the locking handle 114 after removing the spentfilter cup10, the slidingdoor112 is closed, blocking access to thebrew head132 andloading tray124. The control circuitry of thecontrol panel118 will then initiate the rinsing process. During rinsing, water will be pumped from thereservoir116 by thepump138 and heated by theheater136. The hot water will then exit through the shower/brew head132 to rinse/cleanse thebrew head132 andblade assembly128 of remainingcoffee grounds130. In an embodiment, theblade128 will rotate during rinsing to facilitate the removal ofcoffee grounds130 from the blade, as shown inFIG. 57. Steam will then be generated in the manner described above and delivered to theloading tray124 to flush the remaining rinsing water from theloading tray124 and to thecoffee outlet162. During, or immediately prior to the rinsing process, thesolenoid152 controls the three-way valve151 so that the rinsing water andcoffee grounds130 carried therein are directed to thedrain tray120 instead of thespout122. At this point, theloading tray124,blade128 andbrew head132 are free fromcoffee grounds130 and the appliance is ready for another brewing cycle, as shown inFIG. 58. A notification on thecontrol panel118 may remind a user to empty thedrain tray120 after a pre-determined number of brewing cycles.With reference toFIG. 59, the grinding stage of theappliance100 is illustrated in block form. As shown therein, and as discussed above, during the grinding stage thegrinder motor134 will rotate at a high enough frequency to grind thewhole coffee beans18 within thefilter cup10. At the same time, the heater will pre-heat the water from thereservoir116. As shown inFIG. 59, the heater may include asensor194 that controls theheater136 so that a suitable temperature (or temperature range) for brewing is obtained. Theheater sensor194 is electrically coupled to thePCB196 of thecontrol panel118 such that thePCB196 may control the temperature of theheater136 through theheater sensor194.With reference toFIG. 60, the brewing stage of the appliance is illustrated in block form. As shown therein, and as discussed above, the solenoid controls (or is deactivated) the three-way valve151 such that the flow path is to thecoffee spout122. A small amount of water is heated by theheater136 and pumped into thefilter cup10 to pre-wet thecoffee grounds130. Normal brewing is then commenced wherein water is continuously pumped through theheater136 and into thefilter cup10. Importantly, the water temperature is regulated throughout the brewing process for optimum brewing and taste. In connection with this, awater temperature sensor198 detects a temperature of the water exiting theheater136 and relays this temperature to thePCB196 of thecontrol panel118. The heater power and pump rate may then be adjusted to keep the water temperature within the optimal range. Theflow meter140 also keeps track of the flow rate and relays this information to thePCB196. Towards the end of the brewing process, thepump138 will stop first to let theheater136 further heat the water to produce steam, as discussed above. This steam then travels through the system to push the remaining coffee out of thefilter cup10. After all coffee exits thefilter cup10, thepressure release valve148 is opened (in response to a signal from thePCB196 of the control panel 118) to release the pressure inside thefilter cup10. Residual steam or water will then be delivered to thedrain tray120. In the event that the brewing channel is blocked during the brewing process, thesafety valve146 is configured to release pressure to thedrain tray120.Finally, with reference toFIG. 61, the brewing stage of theappliance100 is illustrated in block form. As shown therein, and as discussed above, after a user removed the usedfiler cup10 and pulls down thelocking handle114, theloading tray124 is moved into registration with theshower head132. ThePCB196 checks if thefilter cup10 is removed or is still present (through thepush rods172 and sensor 178). If nofilter cup10 is detected, the rinsing process is automatically initiated. In particular, thesolenoid152 controls the three-way valve151 so that the flow path is to thedrain tray120. A small amount of hot water is pumped into theloading tray124 and thegrinding blade128 is rotated by thegrinder motor134 to remove any remainingcoffee grounds130. Towards the end of the rinsing process, thepump138 will stop first to let theheater136 further heat the water to produce steam, as discussed above. This steam then travels through the system to flush all the rinsing water andcoffee grounds130 from thefilter cup10 to thedrain tray120.Turning now toFIG. 62, a detail view of thecontrol panel118 is shown. As shown therein, thecontrol panel118 includes aLCD display200, a \"MENU\"button202 that allows for function selection and switching between functions by a user, up / downarrows204, 206 for adjusting each function, and a \"BREW\"button208 which initiates the grinding and brewing process. In the preferred embodiment, thecontrol panel118 further includes a \"RINSE\"button210 for manually initiating the rinsing process (in alternative to the automatic rinsing described above) and a \"HOT WATER\"button212 for dispensing hot water only. In the preferred embodiment, major menu functions include grind on/off, auto rinse on/off, auto on settings, auto off settings, default brew size selection and a clock. Each of these functions may be displayed on theLCD display200.While the preferred embodiment contemplates the grinding and brewing of coffee from whole coffee beans, the present invention is not intended to be limited in this regard. In particular, it is contemplated that the present invention apparatus and method are not limited to cups containing whole bean coffee, per se, and the invention may be used with cups containing ground coffee, partially ground coffee, tea leaves, ground tea, or drink mix ingredients. In addition, the appliance according to the embodiments of the present invention can make/brew beverages from any ingredients contained within the filter cup, and is not limited to brewing coffee from whole coffee beans.Although this invention has been shown and described with respect to the detailed embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed in the above detailed description, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of this disclosure.',\n",

As the term is used herein, \"coffee\" refers to a beverage including solids extracted from coffee beans and dissolved in a fluid.[0066] With reference now to FIGS. 1-4, an example of a system configured to prepare a brewed beverage is shown. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the Date Recue/Date Received 2022-07-07 EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 beverage brewing system 20 includes a housing 22 and a fluid reservoir 24. The fluid reservoir 24 is configured to store a desired amount of fluid therein for brewing a beverage, such as coffee or tea for example, and in some embodiments may be removably coupled to the remainder of the housing 22 for ease of use. However, embodiments where the system 20 does not include a fluid reservoir 24 are also contemplated herein. In such embodiments, the system 20 may be connected to a fluid source (not shown) and configured to receive a desired amount of fluid therefrom on demand. Although the fluid typically used to prepare a brewed beverage is fluid, it should be understood that as used herein the term \"fluid\" may include water or any other suitable liquid or fluid.[0067] The system 20 additionally includes a generally hollow brew basket 26 having a brew chamber 28 within which a flavorant F, such as coffee grinds or tea leaves may be housed. In an embodiment, the brew chamber 28 is configured to receive a prepackaged cartridge of flavorant. The term \"cartridge\" as used herein is intended to encompass any capsule, pod, sachet, wrapper or other container or case containing a material suitable for use with a beverage brewing system 20. Alternatively, or in addition, the brew basket 26 may be compatible for use with a loose flavorant. In one embodiment, the brew chamber 28 is configured to receive a disposable or permanent filter (not shown) such as commonly used in conjunction with a loose flavorant during a beverage brewing process.[0068] The outlet end 30 of the brew basket 26 typically includes an opening through which fluid infused with flavorant F is expelled from the brew chamber 28. In an embodiment, a steeping valve 34 arranged adjacent the outlet end 30 is operable to selectively seal the opening 32 and retain fluid within the brew chamber 28, for example to allow the flavorant F to steep within the fluid. The steeping valve 34 may be operated between an open and closed position by any suitable means, such as an actuator 36 for example.[0069] From the brew basket 26, the brewed beverage is directed into an adjacent container 38 either directly or through one or more conduits or chambers.Examples of containers 38 suitable for use with the beverage brewing system 20, include, but are not limited to, a carafe, a half-carafe, a travel mug, and a cup or mug for example. In an embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 1, the brewed beverage may be configured to drip via gravity from the opening 32 formed in the outlet end 30 of the brew basket 26 into the adjacent container 38.[0070] In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 2, a pressure source 40 is arranged in fluid communication with the brew chamber 28 and is configured to force the infused fluid EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 from the brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26. Examples of the pressure source 40 include, but are not limited to a motorized air pump or pressure pump for example, operable to pressurize the interior of the brew basket 26. In such embodiments, the brew basket 26 may be generally sealed against an adjacent component. Further, a valve or other venting mechanism (not shown) associated with the brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26 may be operated to selectively break the seal between the brew basket 26 and the adjacent component such that pressure is vented or released from the brew chamber 28 to the atmosphere. The valve (not shown) may be operably coupled to the pressure source 40 or to a controller of the beverage brewing system 20, to be described in more detail below.[0071] A fluid delivery system 42 is configured to communicate fluid, for example water, from the fluid reservoir 24 to the brew basket 26. The fluid delivery system 42 includes a first supply line or fluid conduit 44 extending between an outlet end of the fluid reservoir 24 and a pumping mechanism 46. A second supply line 48 connects the downstream end of the pumping mechanism 46 to the brew basket 26. Any suitable type of pumping mechanism 46, including but not limited to a gear pump, peristaltic pump, piston pump, wave pump, and diaphragm pump for example, are within the scope of the disclosure.The pumping mechanism 46 provides a positive pumping action to draw fluid from the fluid reservoir 24 through the first supply line 44 and deliver the fluid to the brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26 via the second supply line 48.[0072] The fluid delivery system 42 additionally includes a heating mechanism operable to heat the fluid supplied from the fluid reservoir 24 to a desired temperature prior to delivery to the brew basket 26. Accordingly, the heating mechanism 50 is disposed generally between the pumping mechanism 46 and the brew basket 26 relative to the fluid flow path.In an embodiment, the heating mechanism 50 is a flow through heater or boiler configured to heat fluid within the second supply line 48 as it passes through the heating mechanism 50 for example. However, it should be understood that any suitable heating mechanism 50, such as a heating mechanism including a cavity for retaining a quantity of fluid and a heating element (not shown) for heating the fluid retained within the cavity for example, may be included in the fluid delivery system.[0073] In an embodiment, a pressure relief valve 52 is arranged in communication with the heating mechanism 50 and/or the second supply line 48. The pressure relief valve 52 is selectively operable to release the pressure therefrom by venting steam and/or fluid. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the pressure relief valve 52 is arranged in fluid communication with the fluid reservoir 24 such that vented steam and/or fluid may be EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 recycled within the system 20. In other embodiments, the steam may be vented to the atmosphere adjacent the system 20.[0074] The pumping mechanism 46 may be operable for a predetermined period of time to supply a predetermined amount of fluid to the heating mechanism 50, and therefore the brew chamber 28, based on the size of the beverage being prepared.Alternatively, or in addition, a flow meter 54 may be used to monitor the amount of fluid that passes there through. The flow meter 54 may be located between the fluid reservoir 24 and the pumping mechanism 46, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, or at another location within the fluid delivery system 42, such as between the heating mechanism 50 and the brew basket 26.The amount of fluid that passes through the flow meter 54 may represent the amount of fluid provided to the brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26. Various types of flow meters 54 are within the scope of the disclosure.[0075] After being heated within the heating mechanism 50, the fluid is delivered to the brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the fluid delivery system 42 further includes a shower head 56 positioned directly adjacent an end of the brew basket 28. The shower head 56 is configured to receive heated fluid from the second supply line 48 and deliver the heated fluid to the flavorant within the brew chamber 28. The shower head 56 typically includes a plurality of openings (not shown) that distribute fluid over the flavorant F within in the brew chamber 28 in a desired pattern.[0076] The beverage brewing system 20 may include a user interface 60 for receiving one or more inputs from a user. In an embodiment, the user interface 60 may include one or more buttons, knobs, or other control input devices (not shown), such as for selecting one of a plurality of sizes for example. Alternatively or in addition, the user interface 60 may include a touch screen, or may be configured to receive an input via from a smart device, such as a phone or tablet for example, via an \"app\" or other suitable connection. The selectable brew sizes may include a mug (between about 6 and about 10 ounces), an extra-large mug (between about 8 and about 12 ounces), a travel mug (between about 12 and about 16 ounces), an extra-large travel mug (between about 16 and about 24 ounces), a half-carafe (between approximately 24 and 34 ounces), and a carafe (between about 44 and about 54 ounces). The user interface 60 may additionally include an input device for selecting one of a plurality of types of beverage to be brewed, such as coffee or tea (teas may include black, herbal, oolong, white, green, and delicate), and for selecting a brew style, such as classic, rich, over ice, cold brewed, and specialty. It should be understood that the various inputs EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 described herein are intended as an example only, and that other selectable parameters and options within the disclosed parameters are also within the scope of the disclosure.[0077] Operation of the beverage brewing apparatus 20 is controlled by a controller 70 operably coupled to the pumping mechanism 46, the flow meter 54, the heating mechanism 50, the actuator 36 associated with the steeping valve 34, and in some embodiments the pressure source 40, in response to one or more input signals received from the user interface 60. The controller 70 may include one or more or a microprocessor, microcontroller, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other form of electronic controller known in the art. In an embodiment, the apparatus 20 includes one or more temperature sensors, such as located adjacent the fluid reservoir 24 and/or at the inlet and/or the outlet of the heating mechanism 50 for example, for measuring the temperature of the fluid within the fluid delivery system 42. The controller 70 is configured to control operation of the fluid delivery system 42 to ensure that the heating mechanism 50, and therefore the fluid provided to the brew chamber 28, has a desired temperature.[0078] As previously described, the beverage brewing apparatus 20 may be suitable for use with several different types of flavorants, including both coffee and tea for example.With reference now to FIG. 5, in an embodiment, the beverage brewing apparatus 20 includes a first brew basket 26a configured to receive a coffee flavorant and a second brew basket 26b configured to receive a tea or other botanical flavorant. The first and second brew baskets 26a, 26b are interchangeably coupled to the housing 22 of the beverage brewing apparatus 20.[0079] The controller 70 may be configured to determine which brew basket 26 is coupled to the housing 22 and automatically adjust the one or more options selectable via an input of the user interface 60. In an embodiment, the first brew basket 26a includes a first device Dl and the second brew basket 26b includes a second device D2. The devices Dl, D2 may be coupled, or alternatively, embedded within the corresponding brew baskets 26a, 26b.A corresponding reader 72 disposed within the housing 22 generally adjacent the brew basket 26, such as near the shower head 56 for example, is configured to sense and identify the first device DI and the second device D2 to determine which brew basket 26a, 26b is affixed to the housing 22. In an embodiment, the devices Dl, D2 are magnetic sensors and the reader 72 is configured to distinguish between the first device DI and the second device D2 based on the position of each device Dl,D2 when the corresponding brew basket 26a, 26b is installed relative to the housing 22. However, it should be understood that any suitable device configured to communicate with the reader 72 to detel    mine the identity of the brew basket EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 26, such as a mechanical switch or plunger for example, is within the scope of the disclosure.For example, in an embodiment, the devices D1, D2 may be RFlD tags, and the reader 72 may be an RFID reader.[0080] Further, as suggested, the controller 70 may be configured to automatically adjust the one or more options selectable via an input of the user interface 60 based on which brew basket 26 is coupled to the housing 22. For example, upon detection of the first brew basket 26a associated with the preparation of a coffee beverage, the user interface 60 may allow a user to select one of a plurality of sizes and one of a plurality of styles for preparing a coffee beverage. Similarly, upon detection of the second brew basket 26b associated with the preparation of a tea beverage, the user interface 60 may allow a user to select not only, one of a plurality of sizes and one of a plurality of styles for preparing a tea beverage, but also one of a plurality of different types of teas.[0081] With reference now to FIGS. 6 and 7, each of the brew baskets 26a, 26b includes a first end 74, a second, opposite end 76, and at least one sidewall 78 extending between the first end 74 and the second end 76 to define an interior brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26a, 26b. As shown and previously described, the first end 74 of the brew baskets 26a, 26b are generally open, and the second end 76 of the brew baskets 26a, 26b, are generally closed, having only the opening 32 formed therein.[0082] In an embodiment, a configuration of the brew chamber 28 of each of the first and second brew baskets 26a, 26b, is different. For example, a cross-sectional area of the brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26a associated with the preparation of a coffee beverage may gradually decrease from a first end 74 to a second end 76 of the brew basket 26a.However, the shape of the cross-sectional area of the brew basket 26a may remain generally circular over the height of the brew basket 26a such that the brew chamber 28 is generally frustoconical in shape. In an embodiment, the shape of the cross-sectional area of the brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26b associated with the preparation of a tea beverage, as shown in FIGS. 7A-7C, varies over the height of the brew basket 26b. For example, the brew chamber 28 may transition from having a generally circular cross-sectional shape arranged near the first end 74 to an oval cross-sectional shape near the second end 76.Toward the second, downstream end 76 of the brew basket 26b, the brew chamber 28 is constricted by forming the sidewall 78 with a desired slope to limit expansion of the tea leaves when wetted, and to drain fluid from the brew chamber 28 at a specific rate.[0083] In an embodiment, the brew basket 26b associated with the preparation of a tea beverage may additionally include one or more retaining elements 80 that extend at least EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 partially across the brew chamber 28. Although a single bar-like retaining element 80 is illustrated in the FIGS., other embodiments including multiple retaining elements 80 having similar or varied configurations are also contemplated herein. Further, the retaining elements 80 need not be formed from a solid material. The retaining elements 80 may be removable, or alternatively, may be permanently affixed to a surface of the brew basket 26b, such as the second end 76 thereof for example. The one or more retaining elements 80 are located at a position within the brew chamber 28, offset from the second end 76, to facilitate submerging the entirety of the tea leaves or other botanical flavorant disposed therein within the fluid provided to the brew chamber 28. The retaining elements 80 may be particularly useful during the preparation of a cold brew or over ice beverage. This is because during preparation of a chilled beverage, the fluid provided to the brew chamber 28 is cooler, making the flavorant more difficult to wet and thus more likely to float to the top of the cool fluid.[0084] With reference no to FIGS. 8A and 8B, an example of the shower head 56 is illustrated in more detail. The shower head 56 is disposed within the housing 22, at a position vertically above the brew basket 26. The shower head 56 is arranged in fluid communication with the brew chamber 28. In an embodiment, the shower head 56 has a plurality of holes 82 formed therein, such as in the bottom 84 of the shower head facing the brew basket 26 for example, and the plurality of holes 82 are arranged in an oval pattern. In an embodiment, the overall dimensions and spacing of the oval pattern of holes 82 is designed to evenly wet a smaller volume of coffee flavorant sitting within a standard paper cone filter. Further, the oval shaped cross-sectional area of the brew chamber 28 near the second end 76 of the brew basket 26b associated with the preparation of a tea beverage may be complementary to the oval pattern of holes 82. In an embodiment, the length of the oval cross-sectional shaped portion of the tea basket 26b is adjusted in height so that the maximum amount of flavorant received therein (i.e. the flavorant required when preparing a full carafe) will nest within the oval vertical walled section underneath the showerhead 56. By forming the portion of the brew basket 28 to be filled with flavorant, i.e. tea leaves in a shape generally complementary to the plurality of holes 82 of the shower head 56, the flavorant arranged within the brew chamber 28 will be substantially evenly wetted and submerged when a fluid is supplied thereto, even in embodiments where a maximum amount of flavorant is arranged within the brew chamber 28.[0085] Various parameters associated with a brew cycle for preparing any selectable combination of size, brew style, and type of flavorant are stored within and/or accessible by EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 the controller 70. In an embodiment, the parameters for performing each brew cycle are associated with a recommended volume of flavorant. The recommended or suggested volume of flavorant is dependent not only on the size of the beverage being prepared, but also on the type of flavorant being used. For example, the suggested amount of flavorant used to prepare a cup of cold brew black tea may be different than the suggested amount of flavorant used to prepare a cup of cold brew green tea. In embodiments where the beverage being prepared is a cold brew coffee, the suggested amount of flavorant i.e. coffee grinds, is scaled roughly linearly based on the size of the beverage being prepared. In an embodiment, the amount of flavorant recommended when preparing a 9.5 ounce coffee is approximately 17 grams and the amount of flavorant recommended when preparing an 18 ounce coffee is approximately 21 grams. However, it should be understood that in some embodiments, the suggested amount of flavorant used to prepare different styles of the same size and type of beverage, i.e.a carafe size of classic coffee and a carafe size of cold brew coffee, may vary.[0086] The stored parameters associated with each brew cycle include a total number of infusion cycles and a fluid temperature, volume of fluid, fluid flow rate, and steep duration for each infusion cycle. Each brew cycle associated with the preparation of one of the plurality of beverages by the brewing apparatus 20 includes one or more infusion cycles. In some embodiments, the total number of infusion cycles within a brew cycle may exceed ten infusion cycles, such as twelve infusion cycles for example. However, it should be understood that a brew cycle having any number of infusion cycles is within the scope of the disclosure. The total number of infusion cycles and/or the parameters associated with each infusion cycle, can be adjusted to achieve a desired flavor profile given the beverage type, brew size, and brew style.[0087] A flow diagram of an example of an infusion cycle 100 is illustrated in FIG. 9.In an embodiment, the infusion cycle 100 first includes energizing the heating mechanism 50 to a predefined temperature, as shown in block 102. Operation of the fluid delivery system 42 is then initiated, as shown in block 104, to provide fluid to the heating mechanism 50. The pumping mechanism 46 is configured to move the fluid through the heating mechanism 50 with a controlled flow rate intended to maximize the heat transfer to the fluid and thereby minimize the volume of fluid below the predefined temperature. Operation of the pumping mechanism 46 continues until a predetermined volume of heated fluid is delivered to the brew chamber 28 of the brew basket 26, shown in block 106. After the predetermined volume of fluid heated to a desired temperature is delivered to the brew chamber 28, the pumping mechanism 46 and the heating mechanism 50 are de-energized.EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269[0088] In an embodiment, as the fluid is supplied into the brew chamber 28, the steeping valve 34 may be in a closed position, causing the fluid to accumulate within the brew chamber 28, thereby allowing the flavorant to \"steep\" within the fluid.Accordingly, infusion cycles where the steeping valve 34 is closed as the fluid is supplied to the brew chamber 28 may also be referred to herein as a \"steep\" cycle. After delivery of the fluid to the brew chamber 28, the steeping valve 34 remains closed for a predetermined length of time, shown in block 108. After this steeping time has elapsed, the steeping valve 34 is opened for a specific amount of time and the flavorant infused fluid is allowed to drain through the opening 32 formed in the outlet end 30 of the brew basket 26 into an adjacent container 38, as shown in block 110. As previously described, the infused fluid may drain via gravity, or in response to an air purge generated by operation of the pressure source 40.[0089] Alternatively, in some embodiments, the steeping valve 34 may be arranged in an open configuration as the fluid is supplied to the brew chamber 28. As a result, a portion of the fluid provided to the brew chamber 28 will continuously drain through the opening 32 into an adjacent container 38 until the entirety of the fluid that has not been absorbed by the flavorant is expelled from the chamber 28, as shown in block 112. Accordingly, infusion cycles where the steeping valve 34 is at least partially open as the fluid is supplied to the brew chamber 28 may also be referred to herein as a \"flow through\" cycle. In instances where the flow rate of the fluid provided to the brew chamber 28 is greater than the flow rate of the fluid at the opening 32, the fluid may accumulate at least partially within the brew chamber 28.[0090] In an embodiment, subsequent infusion cycles within a brew cycle may overlap one another to \"blend\" the flavorant infused fluid of each infusion cycle. In such embodiments, a volume of fluid associated with an infusion cycle is provided the brew chamber 28 while the brew chamber 28 is still at least partially filled with fluid from the previous infusion cycle. As a result, the fluid from the first and second sequential infusion cycles mixes within the brew chamber 28, thereby enhancing the consistency between flavorant infused fluid generated during sequential infusions. This blending of infusions may be particularly useful in the brew cycles associated with the preparation of a large tea beverage, such as either the half-carafe, or carafe size. However, it should be understood that such blending of infusion cycles may be used during the preparation of any beverage by the beverage brewing apparatus 20.[0091] The total number of infusion cycles performed by the system 20 within an individual brew cycle will vary based on several factors including the arrangement of the EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 flavorant, and more specifically whether the flavorant is loose or arranged within a cartridge.For example, a brew cycle for preparing a cold brew coffee using loose grounds in an open brew basket 26 typically requires fewer infusion cycles than a brew cycle for preparing a cold brew coffee using a cartridge to achieve proper extraction. Similarly, preparation of a cold brew tea using whole leaf tea may require more infusion cycles, or alternatively, a different number of infusion cycles than if the flavorant were arranged within a tea bag for example. In addition, total number of infusion cycles may also vary based on the complexity and/or grind size of the flavorant, which can affect the extraction thereof. In embodiments where the flavorant has a fine grind size, flavor will extract more quickly than from a flavorant having a larger or coarser grind size. Accordingly, the brew cycle can be adapted to compensate for the configuration (loose or in a cartridge), complexity, and size of the flavorant being used to achieve a desired flavor profile.[0092] In embodiments where a brew cycle includes a plurality of infusion cycles, each of the plurality of infusion cycles may be the same, or alternatively, may be different. In an embodiment, during preparation of a beverage having multiple infusion cycles, the temperature of the fluid provided for each sequential infusion cycle may vary.Because different components or solubles, and therefore flavors, extract from a flavorant at different fluid temperatures, particularly during the preparation of a tea beverage, the temperature of the fluid provided to the flavorant may be controlled to enhance the flavor profile of the resulting beverage. The fluid temperature may therefore be actively adjusted during an infusion cycle to achieve a desired balance between the extracted flavors of the brewed beverage. Accordingly, fluid having a first temperature may be used to extract a first flavor during a first infusion cycle and fluid having a second temperature may be used to extract a second flavor, different from the first flavor, during a second infusion cycle. The difference between the first temperature and the second temperature may be achieve by controlling operation of the heating mechanism 46 and/or by controlling the rate of delivery of the fluid to the shower head 56 and brew chamber 28. In an embodiment, the temperature of the fluid provided for sequential infusion cycles may gradually decrease in temperature.Alternatively, the temperature of the fluid provided for sequential infusion cycles may gradually increase in temperature. In other embodiments, the temperature may be configured to increase between sequential infusion cycles and also decrease between sequential infusion cycles.[0093] In yet another embodiment, the temperature of the fluid provided to the brew chamber 28 within a single infusion cycle may vary. For example, the initial fluid provided to the brew chamber 28 may have a first temperature. After a first volume of fluid at the first EUw0 2019/246411                                           PCT/US2019/038269 temperature has been provided to the brew chamber 28, the temperature of the fluid may be adjusted such that a second volume of fluid r having a second temperature, different from the first temperature, is provided to the brew chamber 28. In such embodiments, the first and second volumes of fluid are provided to the brew chamber 28 substantially continuously. This temperature variation is distinguishable from existing beverage brewing systems that automatically prepare a brewed beverage because those machines are typically designed to maintain the fluid provided to a flavorant at a constant temperature over the entire length of the beverage preparation process.[0094] Further, in an embodiment, during preparation of a beverage having multiple infusion cycles, where the flavorant is steeped within the fluid provided to the brew chamber 28, the length of the steeps of each steep cycle may vary. In an embodiment, the length of the steeps decreases sequentially. Using longer steeps followed by progressively shorter steeps can enhance the flavor profile of the resulting beverage. In an embodiment, the volume of fluid provided to the brew chamber 28 is dependent on the length of the steep.As a result, the volume of fluid may also progressively decrease with each steep cycle.However, embodiments where the steeps are equal lengths and the volumes of fluid are equal, increase sequentially, or vary randomly are also contemplated herein.[0095] During preparation of a cold brewed beverage, the temperature of the fluid delivered to the brew chamber 28 may affect the overall taste of the beverage produced by the system 20. If the fluid is too cold, extraction from the flavorant may be low, and alternatively, if the fluid is too hot, too much acidity may be released from the coffee grinds, and too much astringency may be released from the tea leaves. During preparation of a cold brew beverage, the fluid temperature associated with each steep cycle is between about 30 C and about 50 C. In an embodiment, the fluid temperature associated with preparation of a tea beverage is generally warmer, for example between 48 C and 52 C, such as 50 C, than the fluid temperature associated with preparation of a coffee beverage, generally between 38 Cand 42 C, for example 40 C.[0096] Further, each of the cold brew and over-ice beverages prepared by the beverage brewing apparatus is intended to be received within a container 38 filled at least partially with ice. For example, at least half the volume of the container may be filled with ice cubes for example. When a hot or warm beverage, such as a tea for example, contacts ice, the beverage becomes cloudy, which is generally less appealing to a consumer.In an embodiment, to prevent or reduce this clouding, the flavorant infused fluid output from the brew basket 26 is cooled prior to being dispensed over the ice in the adjacent container. This cooling may occur by allowing the flavorant to steep within the fluid and/or by controlling the flow rate at which the fluid is provided to the container 38.[0097] A beverage brewing apparatus as illustrated and described herein is better able to achieve an ideal flavor for each combination of type, style, and size of beverage prepared.[0098][0100] The use of the terms \"a\" and \"an\" and \"the\" and similar referents in the context of describing the disclosure (especially in the context of the following claims) is to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.

       "  'description': \"FIELD OF TECHNOLOGYThe present disclosure relates to instant foods and, in particular, brewed beverages. Certain embodiments provide a single serve brewing machine.BACKGROUNDThe growth of the single serve coffee and beverage market place is continually increasing, overtaking traditional roast and ground coffee formats. Consumers have adopted the single serve format because it provides good convenience, selection and taste. Today there are two single serve dispensing systems that dominate the market, high water pressure systems for espresso-style coffee, and low pressure water systems for drip-style coffee. Each of these systems provides a different preparation method for coffee.There has been a multiplication of single serve dispensing systems commercialized under such brands as Keurig™, Nespresso™, Tassimo™, Verismo™, Lavazza™ and Illy™, among numerous others. Such dispensing systems receive individual cartridges (also referred to as cups or capsules or cartridges) that contain a precise measure of coffee grounds or tea leaves for a single beverage serving. As noted above, such systems are typically divided into two categories: dispensing systems that accept cartridges for brewing espresso-style coffee under high water pressure; and dispensing systems that accept cartridges for brewing drip-style coffee or tea under low water pressure. Generally speaking, cartridges for brewing espresso and drip-style coffee are not inter-changeable as they are fabricated to meet different technical requirements and, in any case, typically require cartridges of different sizes, shapes and/or geometries.At present, to suitably or optimally offer multiple styles of beverages, two separate dispensing systems must be purchased, one for high water pressure (espresso) and one for low water pressure (drip-style). This situation is undesirable in part for one or more of the following reasons:a) double acquisition costs, b) double the energy use, c) double the counter space consumption and d) double the maintenance.As suggested above, users must choose between one type of machine and beverage over another, or indeed have multiple systems in their homes or offices. Commercial users, such as airlines or quick serve restaurants, contend with limited space requirements yet their customers can have wide tastes ranging from espresso beverages, such as cappuccinos and lattes, to drip-style coffee or tea beverages. Generally speaking, North American coffee drinkers prefer drip-style coffee beverages (e.g., cup of coffee without crema), while Europeans favor espresso-style beverages. The diversity of regional preferences provides an additional motivation to offer both beverage dispensing systems with a reduced footprint.For Europe, high pressure is the most widely used system because high water pressure is needed to maximize coffee extraction, which produces the coffee crema (espresso coffee). In contrast, in North America, a low pressure water system is used, which does not produce any coffee crema (drip coffee). Some North American consumers find crema undesirable in their drip-style coffee. In order to produce espresso coffee, a dedicated beverage preparation system is needed. Similarly, in order to produce a low pressure “drip-style” coffee, a dedicated beverage preparation system is needed. Some consumers have accepted that two appliances on the counter top for preparing coffee are needed in order to deliver an authentic beverage and have adopted two machines in their households or workplaces, one for espresso style beverages and one for drip-style beverages.Various techniques have been developed for providing a brewing system capable of receiving more than one type of cartridge and brewing more than one style of beverage. Past approaches, including those using one or more separate adapters or modules that fit over cartridges having diverse geometries, can suffer from several disadvantages, including inconvenience or misuse if the end user selects an incorrect adapter. As well, the adapters may be detachable or use non-integral components that can be readily damaged or misplaced.Improvements in brewing systems are desirable, including those for single serve beverage brewing including coffee, tea, and powder-based beverages. For example, there is a need for the design and development of a variable water pressure brewing machine with the capability to brew single serve beverages from cartridges having various parameters, geometries or specifications, and therefore providing consumers with a wider beverage variety, a simpler-to-use interface, at reduced cost and reduced space. Furthermore, there is a need for a beverage system which has the ability to enhance extraction results.The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related thereto are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon a reading of the specification and a review of the drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSExamples are illustrated with reference to the attached drawings.

Each single serve preparation zone corresponds to a preparation parameter. The machine body also includes a cartridge acceptor configured to receive a single serve cartridge, a cartridge sorter configured to determine a parameter of the received cartridge and select one of the plurality of single serve preparation zones according to the determined parameter, a transfer sub-assembly configured to transfer the cartridge to the selected single serve preparation zone, and a fluid dispenser for preparing the beverage using the cartridge in the selected single serve preparation zone.Throughout the following description, specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding to persons skilled in the art. However, well-known elements may not be shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring of the disclosure. Accordingly, the description and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative, rather than a restrictive, sense.This disclosure relates generally to instant foods, brewed (extracted) beverages and particularly to a single serve brewing systems.The following description provides a singleserve brewing system100. Thebrewing machine100is capable of accepting espresso-style cartridges (shown as cartridge A inFIG. 1A) and drip-style cartridges (shown as cartridge B inFIG. 1A, sometimes referred to as “K-Cup” format cartridges). Generally, thebrewing machine100is capable of accepting two or more cartridge geometries.Each cartridge A and/or cartridge B is typically fashioned to have a frustoconical shape having a lip or shoulder, however all shapes and surface augmentations are intended to be covered within the scope of the present specification. Typically, cartridges for drip-style coffee or tea are larger than cartridges for espresso-style coffee. Although the examples referred to in this specification refer to coffee beverages, it should be apparent that the specification extends to any beverage or food capable of being packaged in a single serve cartridge including coffee, tea, hot chocolate, among other beverages, as well as soups or other instant foods, etc. The present specification is intended to function with any number of varying cartridge shapes, sizes and/or geometries.The dominant North American “drip-style” cartridge follows the format popularized by Keurig™. The Keurig™ cartridge includes a rigid outer cup or cartridge that is hermetically sealed with a lid at the opening. Within this cartridge, a paper filter is affixed to an interior side wall of the cup so as to form a filter basket for the coffee grounds, creating a two-chamber cartridge as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,765. In the first chamber, coffee grounds intermix with water. The fluid flows through the filter and into the second chamber. It has been observed that a low pressure solution is the only acceptable method to process cartridges having these features. Were high pressure to be used, the paper filter could dislodge from the sidewall (due to poor wet strength), collapsing the two-chamber design and causing coffee grinds to escape into the consumer's cup. Accordingly, skilled readers will appreciate that each unique cartridge geometry or configuration can require its own unique beverage preparation method or process.In contrast, the technical parameters for making an espresso can be quite specific. For example, the parameters outlined by the Italian Espresso National Institute are shown in the following table:TABLE 1sample parameters for making espresso-style beveragesElementParameterPortion of ground coffee7 ± 0.5 g (0.25 ± 0.02 oz)Exit temperature of water from88 ± 2° C. (190 ± 4° F.)unitTemperature in cup67 ± 3° C. (153 ± 5° F.)Entry water pressure9 ± 1 bar (131 ± 15 psi)Percolation time25 seconds ± 5Volume in cup (including froth)25 ± 2.5 mL (0.85 ± 0.08 US fl oz)With espresso, hot water under high pressure is forced through a packed layer of precisely ground coffee to extract a thick, flavorful essence in a concentrated form. Crema refers to the emulsified coffee oils, forced out under high pressure (8-10 bars) while making an espresso. These oils do not mix with water and transforms the properties of the coffee in terms of its mouth feel, density, viscosity (thickness), aroma and taste.Tea brewing depends on such parameters as the quality of the tea leaves, purity of the water, ratio of tea to hot water, correct steeping temperature, correct steeping time, and adequate room for the tea leaves to expand to extract flavor. Tea contains hundreds, if not thousands, of bioactive compounds, including amino acids, caffeine, lignins, proteins, xanthines and flavonoids. The health benefits of tea are most often attributed to tea flavonoids. Tea flavonoids are bioactive compounds that have specific cellular targets that are related to the cardiovascular, chemopreventive, metabolic, neuroprotective and other health benefits. Additional information about the health benefits of tea is found in a Tea Council of the U.S.A., Inc. paper entitled “An Overview of Research on the Potential Health Benefits of Tea”, Available at http://www.teausa.com/teausa/images/TeaCouncil-ResearchDocR5_-_FINAL.pdf; and Su X, Duan J, Jiang Y, Duan X, Chen F. Polyphenolic Profile and Antioxidant Activities of Oolong Tea Infusion under Various Steeping Conditions. International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 2007; 8(12):1196-1205. Generally speaking, research suggests that carefully followed stirring and steeping procedures using appropriate time and temperature affect the health benefits that can be obtained from teas. Infusion conditions have effects on antioxidant potentials and sensory assessment.Below are the temperatures recommended by the Tea Association of the USA for each type of tea:TABLE 2sample parameters for making tea beveragesBlack tea - 3-5 minutes at 201-210° F. (96.1-98.9° C.)Darjeeling tea - 3 minutes at 190-195° F. (87.8-90.6° C.)Oolong tea - 3-5 minutes at 175-195° F. (79.4-90.6° C.)Chinese green tea - 1-3 minutes at 170-180° F. (76.7-82.2° C.)Japanese green tea - 1 to 2 minutes at 160-175° F. (71.1-79.4° C.)White tea - 3 to 4 minutes at about 185° F. (85° C.)Turning now toFIG. 1Aand following, in one example, thebrewing machine100includes a turn-table124(also referred to as a circular cartridge transfer system or transfer sub-assembly). The turn-table124includes a location for accepting or receiving both types of cartridge A and cartridge B, shown as a cartridge acceptance opening136inFIG. 1C. The location and configuration of the cartridge acceptance opening136, or chamber, can vary without departing from the scope of the present specification. The cartridge acceptance opening136provides a universal loading zone for the receipt of cartridges having various parameters, geometries, sizes, specifications, and the like.In accordance with an example, thebrewing machine100includes two or more preparation zones radially located about anaxis112. Each preparation zone can be associated with a housing102(sometimes referred to as brewing chamber). According to the example ofFIG. 1, twohousings102A and102B are provided for brewing beverages having two different parameters, namely the geometries of cartridge A and cartridge B, respectively. Each housing102can include an upper chamber104and a lower chamber108for securing the cartridge A or the cartridge B during the brewing cycle, described in more detail below. In operation, water from a source (such as a water tank or plumbed in water connection), is heated and dispensed through the housing102or brewing chamber to a user's cup via a dispenser nozzle (not shown).In an alternative example, multiple types of cartridges can be prepared or brewed in the same preparation zone. According to this example, thebrewing machine100can be configured to change the pressure of the water passed through the cartridge depending on a parameter of the sensed cartridge, without having to carry the cartridge to a different preparation zone.In a still further alternative example, thebrewing machine100can be configured to havemultiple acceptance openings136and/or dispenser nozzles to accommodate higher throughput needs and/or to reduce cross-contamination (e.g. by providing a single serve tea side and a single serve coffee/espresso side). According to this example (not shown in the drawings), separate motors can drive one or more turn-tables124to deliver cartridges among a plurality of preparation zones associated with eachacceptance opening136. The turn-tables124can be positioned to share a single ejection zone or to eject spent cartridges in different ejection zones.Once the cartridge is loaded in the cartridge acceptance opening136, one or more sensors204detect the cartridge geometry of the received cartridge A or cartridge B.FIG. 2Aprovides an example with twolight sensors204A and204B. A cartridge having the geometry of cartridge A activates (e.g. breaks the path of light of)sensor204A (given by sensor line X), whereas a (larger) cartridge having the geometry of cartridge B activates bothsensors204A and204B (given by both sensor line X and sensor line Y). Accordingly, sensors204can sense, or detect, the cartridge geometry and provide that information to the brewing machine for selection of the appropriate preparation zone and housing102.According to one example, if the consumer inserts a cartridge whose parameter or geometry cannot be identified by thebrewing machine100, the brewing process is by-passed, and the unused cartridge can be transferred directly into the collection hopper612(which can also be referred to as a cartridge disposal zone). At the same moment, the display716(discussed with reference toFIG. 7) can display an “unauthorized cartridge” or other error message to the user. Advantageously, the unauthorized cartridge is not damaged allowing the user to reclaim the cartridge from the disposal zone and use it in a different brewing machine.In one alternative example, the sensor204can be an optical-to-digital reader. The reader flashes a specific light source on a lid of a received cartridge. The reflective light is sensed by the reader. When a particular or unique light wavelength is recognized, the cartridge and preparation parameters can be sensed.According to another example, the one or more sensors204can include an RFID reader, a bar code scanner, a QR code scanner or a tag scanner to sense a tag or taggant imbedded and/or applied to the cartridge. This sensing can determine the selection of the correct preparation zone, determine the use of a genuine or generic cartridge, and/or set other preparation parameters such as desired pressure or steep time (discussed in more detail below). The present specification is not intended to be limited to height sensors or code scanners; many different types of sensors can be used. In another example, thebrewing machine100can receive user input representing the user's selection of the cartridge geometry or preparation parameters through button input, mechanical movement (e.g. movement of the turn-table124), or other user interface input provided on thebrewing machine100or elsewhere (including use of adisplay716which can be a touch-screen). The user interface can be used in conjunction with the sensors204to, for example, select a beverage size (e.g. 6, 8, 12 or 16 ounces or short, long, double espresso, or varying the length of steeping time etc.) for a sensed cartridge. Accordingly, the present specification provides one example technique for cartridge size, shape, or geometry sensing (generically referred to as cartridge geometry sensing). However, the cartridge geometry sensing method can vary according to other techniques that are known in the art.FIG. 2Bprovides a view of the brewing machine interior, with an espresso-style cartridge A loaded in theopening136. One ormore spring members132, tensioned by thesprings208, provide a secure fit of the cartridge A in the cartridge acceptance opening136during transport and in the brewing cycle.FIG. 2Cprovides a view of the brewing machine interior, with a drip-style cartridge B loaded in theopening136.With reference toFIG. 3, alignment guides304ensure that the cartridge A or the cartridge B is properly seated before the cartridge is carried into one of the preparation zones. The alignment guides304can extend or protrude from the upper chamber104, can be inclined, and can also be spring loaded so as to adjust and accommodate cartridge dimensions. The alignment guides304can thereby move back and forth to determine cartridge geometry by sensing cartridge diameter, in one example. Use of the alignment guides304provides universal handling of cartridges ensuring that thebrewing machine100is capable of receiving cartridges of various shapes and dimensions. The alignment guides304can be configured to reject a cartridge if the cartridge's geometry is not compatible with thebrewing machine100.If a cartridge is not seated properly in the cartridge acceptance opening136(e.g., partially tilted), the alignment guides304can secure and properly seat the cartridge in the cartridge acceptance opening136, and thereby ensure the cartridge enters one of the preparation zones in an aligned manner. According to one example, an alignment sensor can ensure the cartridge is seated properly. If the cartridge is not seated properly, then the cartridge can be transferred directly to the ejection zone so as to avoid crushing of the cartridge during the product preparation cycle. Again, thebrewing machine100can display a fault message on thedisplay716advising of the fault.According to a further example, the turn-table124can be driven by a servo motor that is configured to stop accurately during rotation. Instead of sloping guides, a different mechanism of alignment could include a station with a flat surface. When actuated, the flat surface moves downward, applying a slight top pressure on the cartridge ensuring that it is seated in position just before the being transferred to the preparation zone. Many different alignment techniques or approaches are encompassed by the present specification.Advantageously, the present specification provides for universal handling of cartridges of various sizes and/or geometries permitting the consumer to load or place cartridges of various sizes and/or geometries into a singlecartridge acceptance opening136. Thebrewing machine100can then automatically detect and determine the correct preparation zone and water pressure for brewing the accepted cartridge.Turning now toFIG. 4, a top view of the brewing machine interior is shown. In operation, the turn-table124rotates about anaxis112according to the selection of the preparation zone. Loaded with cartridge A, the turn-table rotates about theaxis112in a clock-wise direction. The turn-table124thereby is a transfer sub-assembly that transfers the cartridge A to thehousing102A. Alternatively, loaded with cartridge B, the turn-table rotates about theaxis112in a counter-clockwise direction carrying the cartridge B to thehousing102B. Thespring members132and/or alignment guides304ensure the secure fit of the cartridge in theopening136during carrying or transport. Although the example shown is a turn-table124, many different cartridge transfer sub-assemblies or transport conveying techniques are envisioned within the scope of this specification, including multi-direction (horizontal or vertical) shuttles, sliding arms, and so on.In accordance with one example, thebrewing machine100includes a reservoir or water tank (shown aswater tank710inFIG. 7). According to alternate examples, thewater tank710can be detached or omitted in favor of a plumbed-in water connection. According to one example, the user can select a type of water connection to use (plumbed in or water tank) via a switch or other means improving the portability of thebrewing machine100.FIG. 5Ais a front view, partially cut away, of the interior of thebrewing machine100, according to one example. In this view, each of the housings102are in standby position, waiting for a cartridge to be accepted.InFIG. 5B, a cartridge B has been accepted and the turn-table124has carried the cartridge B to the location of thehousing102B. InFIG. 5C, apiston502B moves down, and pins the cartridge B against the edges of theopening136with a sealing506B. InFIG. 5D, an articulatingarm116B moves thelower chamber108B, closing thehousing102B. The articulatingarm116B can open a fluid exit gate (not referenced inFIG. 5D) and the infusion or brewing process under low water pressure can start.In operation, cartridge B is seated in the turn-table124. Once the cartridge B is carried to the selected preparation zone by rotation of the turn-table124(in this case, the low water pressure preparation zone), the brewing cycle is started. A sealing506B of theupper chamber104B pins down the lip of the cartridge B against the turn-table124to prevent up or down movement of the cartridge B ensuring that the cartridge B is secure during brewing. Then, thelower chamber108B moves up to engage the bottom of the cartridge B. In the example ofFIG. 5Aand following, thelower chamber108B is positioned on an articulatingarm116B. Thelower chamber108B includes an ejection needle504(also referred to as an ejection member, brew extractor needle or portal) that pierces the bottom of the cartridge B. The ejection needle504is a hollow piercing member that moves up vertically and pierces the bottom of the cartridge B, thereby creating an exit channel for the brewed beverage. An injection needle508(also referred to as an injection member) moves down to pierce, or puncture, the top or lid of the cartridge B. In one example, the pressure of the water causes theupper chamber104B (or a component thereof) to move down and pierce or puncture the top or lid of the cartridge B. Once the top or lid of the cartridge B is pierced, the brew cycle commences. Fluid is injected through the cartridge B and the brewed beverage exits through the ejection needle504fluidly connected to a flexible tube carried by the articulatingarm116B, in one example. In this example, fluid enters into thehousing102B; the exiting fluid is a beverage.Turning toFIG. 5E, a cartridge A has been accepted and the turn-table124has carried the cartridge to the location of thehousing102A.InFIG. 5F, the articulatingarm116A moves thelower chamber108A up. InFIG. 5G, thepiston502A moves down to cause sealing506A to close thehousing102A on top of the lid of the cartridge A. Accordingly, the cartridge is pinned down before thelower chamber108B can move up. Upper piercing pins516(referred to generically as injection member(s)) open the top or membrane of the cartridge A, while lower piercing pins512(referred to generically as ejection member(s)) open the bottom of the cartridge A, and the infusion or brewing process under high water pressure can start. The skilled reader will appreciate that for low pressure beverages, a single injection/ejection member can be used. For high pressure beverages, it is typical to have multiple injection needles in, and multiple extraction needles out.Now with reference toFIG. 5H, thepiston502A is shown in a first resting position. InFIG. 5I, thepiston502A is shown in a second position, moving the sealing506A into place and pinning the cartridge A against the turn-table124. InFIG. 5J, thepiston502A is shown in a third closed position. Theupper chamber104A is completely down, while thelower chamber108A is completely up, thereby closing thehousing102A and permitting brewing or infusion under high water pressure to be performed. Fluid or steam is injected through the cartridge A and the brewed beverage exits through the ejection member fluidly connected to a flexible tube carried by the articulatingarm116A, in one example. Again, in this example, fluid enters into thehousing102A; the exiting fluid is a beverage.After brewing, and upon release of the water pressure, the upper chamber104(or a component thereof) relaxes. The articulatingarm116moves into rest position, which moves the lower chamber108away from the cartridge A or the cartridge B. However, the cartridge remains pinned to the upper chamber104(or the sealing506). According to one example, pinning of the lip of cartridge is important to ensure that the cartridge remains fixed during the withdrawal of the ejection needle504(or piercingpins516, generically referred to as extraction piercing member) and ensures that the spent cartridge remains seated properly in the turn-table124, ready for ejection.Accordingly, the methods disclosed herein according to one example provide the steps of pinning a lip of the cartridge, piercing a first location (e.g. top) of the cartridge, closing a housing and piercing a second location (e.g. bottom) upon closing of the housing. After extraction of the brewed beverage, the reverse happens: the housing is disengaged, the first piercing member retracts, then the cartridge is un-pinned. In one example, each preparation zone can have separate ejection and injection members or an injection/ejection arrangement. Advantageously, the present specification provides a cartridge piercing method with improved extraction efficiency and/or quality in a reduced footprint.Current approaches to single serve brewing solutions typically involve a brewing machine and a cartridge. These solutions require that the consumer insert the cartridge into a cartridge receiving chamber of the brewing machine. Typically, the cartridge receiving chamber has both water injection needle or needles (required for piercing lid) and extraction needle (required for piercing base). Both needles are rigidly fixed to the receiving chamber and are mechanically linked together so as to function as one coupled system. When the consumer uses the handle to close the chamber, both the injection needle or needles and extraction needle pierce and penetrate the cartridge at the same time. During infusion, a continuous fluid path is formed (meaning water will make its way into cartridge and will flow out of the cartridge in a continuous fashion).Providing a channel with a continuous fluid path means that there is limited contact time of the fluid with the extractable or soluble matter, resulting in poor and/or inefficient extraction/solubility. Some prior single serve dispensing solutions attempt to address this problem through intermittent water infusion (spraying) to “prepare” or “pre-wet” the extractable matter for better extraction. The “spray” approach can be problematical: it may not completely cover/surround the total extractable matter hence leaving the product improperly prepared for complete extraction. Due to this shortcoming, product developers may also add more product than necessary to cartridges so as to provide sufficient product surface area available during the brew/extraction cycles.Furthermore, when employing the use of powder products within a cartridge, contact time and submersion time ensures full product solubility and avoiding and/or minimizing the residue in cartridge, in the brewing machine, and in the consumer's cup.As mentioned above, different tea types (green, black, etc.) require different steeping times (leaves fully immersed in water) due to unique absorption and extraction requirements. When dried, whole leaf teas shrink and/or take-up minimum space, however, when immersed in water, the dry leaves absorb water and grow in size by in some cases a factor of ×5 or greater. Whole leaf tea leaves should be packed loosely to provide sufficient space during the extraction process and minimize leaf damage. In single serve format (K-Cup style), tea products perform poorly and are expensive vs. traditional tea bags. Traditional tea bags, because of longer extraction times utilize significant less tea (e.g. about 1.5 to about 3 grams per tea bag, cartridge solutions are at least double, if not about 3× or more) and can be used to make multiple servings and because there is a longer steeping time product tastes significant better relative to a cartridge solution. Generally speaking, tea cartridge have not been successful because of the above noted shortcomings.The use of paper filters can further impede the quality of extraction process. Paper is highly hydrophilic (meaning it promotes fluid conductivity) and hygroscopic (meaning it absorbs water about 6× its own weight). Current single serve brewing cartridges that include a paper (cellulose based filters) filter absorb a partial amount of the extracted material, resulting in a beverage that is light and thin.Now with reference toFIG. 10A, according to one example of the present specification, in part to overcome these and other shortcomings, thebrewing machine100can be configured to produce a concentrate within the cartridge, which is particularly suitable for some coffee or tea beverages. According to this technique, thebrewing machine100has the ability to flood the interior portion of a cartridge A or a cartridge B containing ingredients140(sometimes referred to as steeping, deep steeping, or holding a steep for several seconds or more) prior to the ejection piercing taking place and completion of brewing according to the techniques disclosed above. Thus it will be appreciated that steeping within a cartridge refers to soaking cartridge ingredients within the cartridge (i.e., a small cup) and optionally decaying the resulting concentrate into the user's cup (i.e., a larger cup). Immersing or inter-mixing cartridge ingredients in water and holding in this “bathing” state for an extended period of time can result in super-saturation of cartridge ingredients and improved extraction and/or full solubility (latter is for powders). Steeping generally refers to the soaking in liquid (usually water) of a solid so as to extract flavors or to soften the solid. Some teas are prepared for drinking by steeping the leaves in heated water to release the flavor and nutrients. Herbal teas may be prepared by decoction, infusion, or maceration.Current solutions that cause injection and ejection piercing of cartridges at the same time do not generally permit fluid to accumulate or to be held within the cartridge. According to these solutions, the extraction cycle is not efficient, requiring product developers to add more product content to compensate. According to the steep techniques disclosed in the present specification, product developers can lower the product content and achieve better extraction, an improved beverage and lower cost. Using less product content causes less food waste, and provides an improved environmental footprint.Thus, it can be seen that thebrewing machine100according to disclosed examples can de-couple the piercing function of theinjection member134from theejection member138so as to have a multi-step brewing cycle.According to one example, as shown inFIG. 10A, injection piercing of the cartridge can be activated via directing high pressure water from a centralized water system of thebrewing machine100so as to activate a downward motion of the upper piercing member (i.e. activating the piston). Once theinjection member134is in its fully engaged position (eventually piercing the top or membrane of the cartridge A or cartridge B), theinjection member134can be held in this position until control means126(not shown) of thebrewing machine100releases this operation. Theejection member138can be selectively moved (e.g. raised) only when initiated by the control means126, after a time period as shown inFIG. 10B. In one example, the control means126include a servo motor drive. Advantageously, use of a servo motor drive yields fine control and gentle piercing action that may be required for some materials. As well, the two stage piercing system allows thebrewing machine100to perform a “steep” function, as outlined in more detail below.According to an alternative example illustrated inFIG. 11A, injection and ejection piercing can occur at the same time, but a valve can prevent the fluid from being ejected until after a specified delay or event. For example, after a time period has passed, then the valve can be opened, via the control means126or other electronic or mechanical means, as shown inFIG. 11B. The valve can be configured to close again, to permit multiple cycles of steeping to occur, or in one example can be used in combination with the process described with reference toFIG. 10AandFIG. 10B.An example follows: Step 1—the injection member134(such as injection needle508) pierces the lid of the cartridge, and injects a specific amount of water which will nearly fill the cartridge (but not exceed the volume of the cartridge), leaving the ingredients fully immersed in water (i.e., charging the cartridge, this will be the partial amount of water required to make the complete beverage) (e.g., 1.5 oz of an 8 oz beverage);Step2—The charged cartridge undergoes a holding time of >1 second, specific time will depend on the sensed cartridge or user input;Step3—After the holding time has been reached, the ejection member138(such as ejection needle508) pierces the bottom of the cartridge, allow the charge liquid (i.e., 1.5 oz concentrate) to exit the cartridge; and Step 4—After the concentrate has exited the cartridge, the balance of the brew cycle 6.5 oz of water can flow through the cartridge fluid delivery path. Now that theingredients140have be optimally prepared for extraction in Step 1 &Step2, the balance of the brew cycle can now extract the balance ingredients of the for making the beverage. The beverage is then dispensed throughdispenser116.A variation to the above steps inStep #2 adds an air percolation cycle while the cartridge is charged. The slow insertion of air can help agitate the ingredients improving extraction and/or solubility. Another variation in Step #4 injects the water at a slower rate so as to further extract more out of the ingredients.The cartridge can be configured to have a headspace (i.e., product free area), to permit expansion of the ingredients (e.g. tea). If there is insufficient space for product expansion, theinjection member134can get blocked causing back pressure and/or water leakage during pre-infusion or brewing. Prior solutions dealing with espresso cartridge headspace require that product be tightly packed, however this approach leaves limited space for tea extraction and/or creates an inferior environment for total ingredient submersion. Therefore, it has been discovered that good conditions for extraction indicate a cartridge with about 5% or more free headspace, depending on product expansion needs. Accordingly, the desired headspace for most teas would be in the range 10-20%, however a range of 20 to 50% or more headspace can be expected depending on product characteristics.Examples of steep techniques can be configured to work for cartridges with or without paper filters.A touch-based interface of thebrewing machine100can be provided to customize one or more settings, such as the steep setting, offering “craft-like” beverage experience. As noted above, teas require different steeping times. The steep can be customized upon receipt of user input at a touch-sensitive display (e.g. “Green Tea”, “Oolong Tea”, etc.), or via a taggant or other code read by thebrewing machine100.The steep techniques can be applied to powder-based beverages. Current solutions that pierce upper and lower portions of the cartridges at the same time make it difficult to fully dissolve powders. According to the steep techniques disclosed herein, powders can sit in water for an extended time improving the solubility of the resulting beverage.It has been discovered that seven (7) seconds of steeping produces acceptable results for green tea, however short or longer holding times may be require for other beverage types. For example, a soup cartridge may require 20 seconds so as to ensure solubility of the dry powders. The steep function allows water to fully contact the extractable content contained within the cartridge (coffee grounds, tea leaves) so as to optimize the brew cycle. In one example, the steep can be held for five (5) seconds or longer. Other times or ranges are intended to be included within the scope of the present specification.Moreover, according to one example, thebrewing machine100can be configured to perform a “clean brew” function. According to this example, thebrewing machine100can be configured to perform a flush cycle after each brewing, providing less flavor transfer and cross-contamination. In this example, after a spent cartridge is ejected (discussed in more detail below), the turn-table124can rotate back to the housing102(i.e., the brewing location). Upon the closing of the upper chamber104and the lower chamber108, a final brew cycle takes place, flushing the housing102and leaving the housing102clean for the next product. Once this cycle is done, the turn-table124rotates back into home position ending the brew cycle. In one example, all water cycles end up in the cup or a waste container (shown as914inFIG. 9). Optionally, an air purge can be used during the final flush of the housing102to ensure a more robust cleaning of thebrewing machine100.For example, thebrewing machine100can be configured to perform the following functions in sequence, for an 8 oz hot chocolate (cocoa-based product): Stage One: Steep (2 oz water); Stage Two: Pierce and Partial Brew (6 oz water); and Stage Three: Clean Brew (2 oz water).FIG. 6Ais a top view of the interior of thebrewing machine100in a brewing position. Once the brewing cycle has completed, the turn-table124can rotate to carry (or otherwise transport) the spent cartridge B, for example, to an ejection zone. In one example, thebrewing machine100includes a single ejection zone; however, multiple ejection zones are contemplated within the scope of the present specification.FIG. 6Billustrates the rotation of the turn-table124carrying the spent cartridge B to an ejection zone. The ejection zone can include acollection hopper612andcollection hopper interior604. In this example, turn-table124engages withcam608on a cam path causing the eventual displacement of the cartridge B from theopening136.FIG. 6CandFIG. 6Dshows further rotation of the turn-table124along the cam path causing the spent cartridge to fall into the collection hopper612(detachment of the cartridge is not shown).According to one example, thecollection hopper612can be detached or omitted. In this configuration, an opening or exit chute614is positioned at the bottom of thebrewing machine100permitting spent cartridge to fall out of the brewing machine100(e.g. into a waste bin). When thebrewing machine100is positioned on a counter, and the waste bin is placed under the counter, spent cartridges can fall through a counter hole directly into the waste bin.According to other examples, the organic material contained within the spent cartridge can be extracted before or after ejection and can be collected in a separate collection hopper. The top or lid of the cartridge B may be cut to facilitate the extraction. The spent cartridges may be crushed or otherwise reduced in size before ejection. According to one example, a sensor616(not shown) may sense, or detect, if the spentcartridge collection hopper612is full and cause error handling procedures to be engaged (such as a warning or other message to the user). Advantageously, thebrewing machine100can provide for the automatic ejection of the spent cartridge after the brewing cycle is completed, saving the user from having to handle a cartridge that has come into contact with hot fluids.In one example, each preparation zone can use separate dispenser paths to avoid flavor transfer and cross-contamination. Each of the following styles of beverage can have a separate preparation zone: espresso, coffee, tea, soup, and so on. While the present specification has described one method of beverage preparation depending on such variables as cartridge size and/or desired water pressure, it will be apparent that many methods of preparation of the beverage are intended to be included within the scope of the present specification.FIG. 7is a perspective view of thebrewing machine100according to one example. Thebrewing machine100can include adisplay716, adrawer handle712, adrip tray708, awater tank710, one or more heaters728(e.g. boiler, thermoblock, thermocoil, etc.), atop surface724which can be made of stainless steel, and aside wall720. Theheater728can be a boiler that is positioned proximate, or near, thetop surface724to warm serving cups stored on top of thebrewing machine100. The shape or functions of thebrewing machine100can vary, without departing from the scope of the present specification. The present specification provides a reduced space, single serve brewing machine design, with multi-variable water pressure capabilities. According to one example, thedisplay716is a touch-screen display that permits customized product preparation. Thebrewing machine100can include computer hardware comprising a processor, data storage, and a network interface device and can be configured to communicate with user devices such as tablets, laptops, desktops, smart phones, smart watches, smart home devices, wearables, and the like. Communication protocols can include USB, BlueTooth, wired or wireless networking, and the like. In one example, the brewing machine can include a USB port permitting the user to update the brewing machine software/firmware and to gain access to user data or analytics.FIG. 8is a side perspective view of thebrewing machine100, showing internal components. Theboiler728is illustrated, as well as a plurality of electro-valves804that carry the water for use during the brewing cycle. The configuration of these components can be varied without departing from the scope of the present specification.Now with reference toFIG. 9, in accordance with one example, the plumbing system for thebrewing machine100includes a pump904(not shown) delivering water to the two different brewing chambers, or housings102, of thebrewing machine100. This enables thebrewing machine100to satisfy these requirements: correct amount of water and flow rate; correct pressure for hydraulic pistons502; and correct pressure for infusion of cartridge A beverages (espresso style); or correct pressure for infusion of cartridge B beverages (coffee, tea, etc.). In an alternative example, one ormore pumps904can be employed (e.g. a high-pressure pump for espresso-style beverages, and a low-pressure pump for drip-style beverages).It will be appreciated that different housings102can require different water pressure settings. For example, it has been observed that, forhousing102A (espresso style), at least about 17-18 Bar is needed during infusion into hydraulic piston to ensure good closure and sealing; and up to about 15-16 Bar is needed during infusion insidehousing102A. Forhousing102B (K-Cup style), at least about 17-18 Bar is needed during infusion into hydraulic piston to ensure good closure and sealing; however, low pressure during infusion is desired (e.g. from about 0 to 2 Bar).According to one example, thepump904directs (cold) water from the water tank into the piston502to close the housing102and also directs water to one or more heaters728(e.g. thermoblocks) for (hot) water infusion. The pressure of the pump is configured to increase according to the needs of the sensed cartridge (e.g. cartridge A or cartridge B). Once the infusion is completed and the beverage prepared, then all pressure to both the piston502and to theheater728can be released.The following description analyzes the steps in both kinds of infusions: cartridge A (espresso style) and cartridge B (K-Cup style): 1) Pump904starts; 2) Cold water from thepump904enters a one-way valve906into an electro-valve908controlling (hydraulic) piston502; 3) Cold water from the electro-valve908enters into piston502for securing the housing102; 4) Once piston502has completed movement, water pressure increases as thepump904continues to work; 5) Pressure increases as water has nowhere to go; 6) Control means126open a hot electro-valve910; and 7) Hot water enters the cartridge for infusion.The skilled reader will appreciate that the cold water holds the pressure in the piston502by keeping open the electro-valve908, while the one-way valve906placed on electro-valve ensures that pressure is not lost (ensuring a secure closure of housing102). At the same time and for the same reason, hot water from theheater728flows into the housing102which starts from zero pressure to brew the beverage. Once water enters the cartridge, water pressure starts to rise again. Water pressure for infusion can be determined by the control means126.Depending on the characteristics of the ingredients inside the cartridge, giving more or less difficulty for water to pass, the infusion pressure for cartridge A (espresso style) can be variable (e.g. from about 8 to 15 Bar). A similar variability can be observed for cartridge B (K-Cup style) due to the size of the grind or other characteristics when using leaf or other kind of products. In the case of some cartridge formats, such as those marketed under the Vitha™, Rivo™ or Lavazza™ Blue™ brands, for example, infusion pressure can increase first to let the cartridge expand and open. After the cartridge is opened, brewing of the beverage occurs.It will be appreciated that, during infusion, piston502is subject to pressure of up to about 18-19 Bar, enabling the housing102to be secured and/or piercing of the cartridge. Once piston502is full, water cannot go back so the pressure increased inside the piston502will be kept there, ensuring the housing102is secured. Once the infusion is completed, the cold clean water can be returned to thewater tank710. For infusion, however, housing102is subject to pressure of up to a totally different value which is near zero for infusion of cartridge B (K-Cup style) and a higher value for infusion of cartridge A (espresso style). As mentioned, the pressure drops to zero when the hot water flow is opened.

No. 08/037,814, filed Mar. 26, 1993, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT[Not Applicable]MICROFICHE/COPYRIGHT REFERENCE[Not Applicable]BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application relates in general to a device and process for making hot beverages and hot beverages made thereby. Specifically, this application relates to an improved device and process for making coffee and espresso coffee (sometimes called “expresso”) beverages or other hot beverages, and more particularly, but not exclusively, to an improved device and process for making coffee, tea, espresso, and the like for individual servings in a microwave oven.The general method of making espresso is well known. It involves the process or method of forcing hot water or steam through a particulate brewing substance (conventional coffee grounds or extra fine coffee grounds for example). This pressure method for making coffee differs significantly from the common methods for making drip-type or percolation coffees. The espresso may be brewed with a mixture of espresso coffee grounds and cinnamon or other flavored syrups such as almond, orange, hazelnut, chocolate and the like. Espresso generally is a dark full-bodied brew and may also be served as cappucino, caffe latte, caffe Americano, doppio, or macchiato.Microwave ovens are widely known and used for a variety of heating tasks, including heating water for instant beverages or heating other beverages and foods. Several devices have been proposed for brewing coffee in microwave ovens, described in the related patent and patent applications identified above and incorporated herein by reference.U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,785, issued Jan. 25, 1994 (Pasbrig), discloses a device for preparing coffee or tea in a microwave oven. The device has a liquid container, a centrally-located coffee container/filter, a drink container, and a handle. The path of the pressurized heated liquid is from the closed liquid container up through the coffee container/filter into the drink container.U.S. Pat. No. 3,757,670, issued on Sep. 11, 1973 (Laama et al), discloses a two vessel electric coffeemaker wherein water is forced from the lower metal vessel through a centrally-located coffee container to the upper metal vessel so that the percolate is collected in the upper vessel. An electrical heating element integrally constructed in the base of the device.U.S. Pat. No. 4,498,375, issued on Feb. 12, 1985 (Bedini), discloses an automatic coffeepot in which the pressurized, heated liquid is forced up through a coffee-containing filter in a manner similar to Laama et al. A gas flame or electric heating coil is used to heat the coffeemaker.U.S. Pat. No. 4,642,443, issued on Feb. 10, 1987 (Jorgensen et al), discloses a coffee brewing appliance for making coffee by the percolation method in a microwave oven. U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,396, issued on Jan. 7, 1992 (Katz et al), also discloses a microwave coffee percolating device. These devices disclose a percolating or drip-type technique for making coffee.U.S. Pat. No. 4,104,957, issued Aug. 8, 1978 (Freedman et al), discloses a coffee brewing appliance comprising a carafe, a filter that fits in the neck of the carafe, and a water reservoir located over the filter. The water reservoir communicates with the filter by way of a thermally-controlled valve. When water in the water reservoir is heated by microwave radiation, the valve opens, allowing the water to flow into the filter, extracting coffee constituents from coffee grounds in the filter, so that a coffee beverage accumulates in the carafe.U.S. Pat. No. 4,577,080, issued Mar. 18, 1986 (Grossman), discloses an appliance similar to that of Freedman et al, except that instead of using a thermally-controlled valve to prevent cold water from the water reservoir from contacting coffee grounds in a filter. This device uses a body of non-toxic wax that melts when the water reaches the desired temperature.U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,835, issued Jan. 26, 1988 (Welker), discloses a device for brewing coffee in a microwave oven. The device comprises a jug having a top configured as a filter. Water and coffee grounds are placed in the jug, and the filter is fitted in the mouth of the jug. After brewing, the coffee may be poured from the jug, while the coffee grounds are retained by the filter.U.S. Pat. No. 4,386,109, issued May 31, 1983 (Bowen et al), discloses an espresso coffee maker used in a microwave oven. The water is stored in a microwave transparent reservoir which is adjacent to an aluminum pot. The pot and reservoir are coupled in a fixed spatial relationship by a collar. The collar includes a strainer which presses against a layer of coffee grounds, when the collar is secured to the reservoir. The compressed coffee grounds, in combination with the strainer, form a pressure resistant seal over the opening of the reservoir. The water in the reservoir is heated by microwave energy. The pressure rises to a level sufficient to force steam and water in a downward direction through the coffee grounds into the pot, which stores the espresso coffee.U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,696, issued May 3, 1983 (Koral), discloses a coffee brewing appliance that is generally similar to that disclosed by Freedman et al.U.S. Pat. No. 4,345,512, issued Aug. 24, 1982 (Moore), discloses a tea infuser for use in a microwave oven. The tea infuser is made of microwave-transparent plastic material rather than metal.U.S. Pat. No. 5,012,059, issued Apr. 30, 1991 (Boatman), discloses a device for heating water in a microwave oven. In Boatman's device, water is heated in a water reservoir, then forced from the water reservoir through a tube into a heating chamber, where it is further heated prior to draining through a filter filled with coffee grounds.U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,734, issued Feb. 5, 1991 (Hirsch et al), discloses a method of preparing coffee. In this device a mixture of water and coffee grounds is heated with microwave radiation, whereby a pressure gradient is produced across a filter, forcing filtrate into a vessel.German No. OS 3,206,803 includes a coffeepot, a filter to receive coffee, and a water container seated one upon the other. The water container is pervious to microwave radiation and the filter is developed so that substantially no liquid can pass through the filter under atmospheric or ambient pressure. The device is placed in a microwave oven where microwave radiation brings the water in the water container to a boil, while the coffee remains screened off. The formation of steam develops such a high pressure in the water container (up to about 3.45 bar) that the water is forced through the filter.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONOne of the objects of the present invention is to provide a safe and convenient method and device for brewing hot beverages (coffee, tea, espresso coffee, or other hot beverages, as well as other espresso beverages such as cappucino, caffe latte, caffe Americano, doppio or macchiato for example) in a microwave oven.Another object of the present invention is to provide a compact device for making coffee, tea, espresso beverages, or the like in a microwave oven, from which device one may conveniently drink individually-sized servings.Still another object of the present invention is to provide a compact device for making coffee, tea, espresso beverages, or the like in a microwave oven and providing for adequate pressure-relief and/or improved pressure dissipation within the device for safety of operation.Another object of the present invention is to provide a device for making hot beverages (coffee, tea, or espresso beverages for example) in a microwave oven and providing an improvement in the consistency of brewing by providing a filter/pod compartment which promotes constant flow of water and consistent cycle length of brewing regardless of the type of particulate brewing substance used or degree of packing imposed on the particulate brewing substance.Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device for making individually-sized servings of heated beverages using microwave energy.

For the purpose of illustrating the invention, certain embodiments are shown in the drawings. It should be understood, however, that the present invention is not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality shown in the attached drawings.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONReferring toFIG. 1there is generally shown an embodiment of amicrowave beverage maker10. Thebeverage maker10generally includes anupper cup assembly12, abottom assembly14, and ahandle16. It is contemplated that thebeverage maker10may include a filtrate splash cover (not shown). In at least one embodiment, thebeverage maker10may be generally constructed of a plastic microwave-transparent, pressure-resistant material suitable (for example, polypropylene, PET® polyethylene terephthalate, polyester, ULTEM® polyether imide, polysulphane, or ULTEM® LTX Series polyether imide-polycarbonate blend) for contact with beverages. By microwave-transparent, it is meant that microwave energy will pass through the material without substantial loss of energy.In at least one embodiment ofbeverage maker10, theupper cup assembly12includes a generally cup-like filtrate reservoir18which is adapted to receive a cup or liner20(a thin aluminum cup which is molded in place for example) having first orupper reservoir39. In one embodiment,liner20shields any beverage contained therein from microwave energy, preventing the beverage from being overheated.FIG. 1further illustratesbottom assembly14which, in one embodiment, comprises gasket valve orgasket400, filter/pod compartment24and bottom cover26having second or lower liquid orwater reservoir28.Bottom cover26includes a receptacle30(best viewed inFIG. 2) for receiving filter/pod compartment24; the filter/pod compartment24holding coffee grounds, tea, espresso or other particulate brewing substance. The general shape of the components as well as whether the components are integrally molded together or are multiple affixed pieces are matters of design choice.FIG. 2illustrates thebottom cover26ofbeverage maker10includingreceptacle30positioned centrally inlower reservoir40, wherereceptacle30is adapted to removably receive the filter/pod compartment24. Furthermore, in at least one embodiment,upper cup assembly12defines at least onefiltrate passage32having at least one opening, for fluidly conducting steam and water from at least the filter/pod compartment24to at least thefiltrate reservoir18. In at least one embodiment,filtrate passage32is formed by passageinterior surface42,passage side walls44, and passage backwall46integrally molded within a portion of theupper cup assembly12. In the illustrated embodiment,upper cup assembly12defines the at least onefiltrate passage32having two openings, first andsecond openings34and36.Thebottom cover26includinglower water reservoir40releasably engages theupper cup assembly12andupper reservoir39atconnection38. It should be appreciated that any known releasable attachment mechanism is contemplated. Such engagement engages the removable filter/pod compartment24andgasket400between thereservoir28andupper cup assembly12, such that thefirst opening34of thefiltrate passage32fluidly engages at least an upper portion ofgasket400, enabling fluid to pass from the reservoir28(into lower andupper reservoirs40and39for example) in a direction up through the filter/pod compartment24into at least thefiltrate reservoir18.To operate, ground coffee, tea, or other espresso particulate brewing substance, either loose, in a porous block form, contained in a paper bag or other filter, or in a filtrate pod as provided below, is placed within the filter/pod compartment24. The upper filter is reconnected or attached to the upper edges of filter/pod compartment24. The filter/pod compartment24is placed within thereceptacle30of thereservoir28such that the filter/pod compartment24is located generally in the flow path between thefiltrate passage32andreservoir28. A suitable quantity of water is poured into thereservoir28, and the annular end of thecircular bottom cover26is removably connected to theupper cup assembly12atconnection38. Thegasket400forms a substantial seal or seat between thefiltrate passage32and the filter/pod compartment24, where, in at least one embodiment, thegasket400substantially closes the path for passage of liquid and steam from the filter/pod compartment24to thefiltrate passage32.Upon application of the microwave energy, the liquid (water for example) in thereservoir28heats up, forms steam, and increases pressure in reservoir28(at an upper portion ofupper reservoir39for example). When the pressure within the filter/pod compartment24reaches a predetermined level (approximately 5 psi for example), the steam pressure in thereservoir28opensgasket400, deflecting the gasket (the central area for example) upward or away from the upper filter, thus opening the central area or passage normal kept closed by central mountingpost306. The steam pressure further forces hot liquid and steam to rise upwards through the filter/pod compartment24, the particulate brewing substance, thefiltrate passage32and into thefiltrate reservoir18. In at least one embodiment a filtrate splash cover (not shown) is removably connected to an upper portion ofupper cup assembly12. The cover serves to break up bubbles and deflect liquid into thefiltrate reservoir18and to contain steam within the filtrate reservoir, where it may cool and condense. The cover thereby limits the undesired escape of fluid and steam into the microwave oven. The process continues until most of the water has been discharged into thefiltrate reservoir18. Espresso may be brewed in approximately two to three minutes, depending upon the power of the oven, the quantity of espresso being brewed, and the atmosphere conditions.As illustrated,filtrate reservoir18is generally cylindrical and formed bywall48.Handle16is illustrated integrally connected to anouter surface50ofupper cup assembly12.Reservoir28is formed bywall52, downwardly, inwardly slopingwall54andbottom wall56which are integrally connected together.Opening36is formed inwall48at a location generally aligned with an upper portion of thehandle16.Bottom cover26may have a convexouter surface58and/or one ormore fins60to improve stability of thebeverage maker10when placed on a surface.In one embodiment thereceptacle30includesinner receptacle surface62andouter receptacle surface61, forming a pocket for removably receiving the filter/pod compartment24. Thereceptacle30may utilize any alternative configuration or structure to hold or align the filter/pod compartment24in place. As illustrated,inner surface62forms alip64that removably engages adetent66formed in the filter/pod compartment24.FIGS. 1 and 2depict the filter/pod compartment24as generally cylindrical, although other configurations are suitable, and includes one or more filters (lower and upper filters for example). In at least one embodiment, filter/pod compartment24has an inside diameter which is generally constant. Thecompartment24may be fixed or self-contained and removable. The cylindrical filter/pod compartment24has acylindrical wall68that definesdetent66. An upper annular ledge70is formed at the top ofcylindrical wall68of the filter/pod compartment24.FIG. 3depicts an embodiment of a filter300(an upper filter for example) that removably sits on upper ledge70during operation.Filter300comprisessupport ribs302extending fromsupport post306in a spaced radial direction on either the upper or lower sides of thefilter300or both and anouter support ring304. One or more recessedsurfaces308are located within a substantial portion of the areas defined by thesupport ribs302andsupport ring304. In at least one embodiment,filter300has an outside diameter which is substantially the same as the outside diameter of the upper portion of the filter/pod compartment24. In one embodiment,filter300is threadably mounted to the filter/pod compartment24, although a pin, hinge or other suitable mechanisms or structures are contemplated.FIG. 3further illustrates that thefilter300has a plurality of openings orperforations310of a size and number sufficient to retain the particulate brewing substance, while allowing passage of steam and water. The size of the openings may range from 0.020 to 0.040 inches in diameter; although other sizes may be suitable depending on the size of the particulate brewing substance. Further, the openings may range from 100 to 150 in number. In one embodiment, there are 124openings310having an equal combination of openings 0.032 inches and 0.040 inches in diameter. A centralupper mounting post306is illustrated defined by the central upstanding portion ofupper filter300and sized to fit within an opening ofgasket400.In one embodiment, a lower filter (not shown) is contemplated coupled to the lower portion of the filter/pod compartment24. It is contemplated that the lower filter may be similar to that depicted inFIG. 3or different therefrom. The lower may be removably connected to or integrally formed in the filter/pod compartment24.Referring now toFIGS. 4–7, one embodiment of gasket orvalve400is illustrated. The gasket orvalve400is made of any suitable resilient material (food grade silicon rubber for example) and adapted to fit within a space of thebottom cover28between a top surface offilter300and the lower surface ofupper cup assembly12. A gasket having a hardness of approximately 60 durometer, was found to provide pressure relief at approximately 5–6 psi. Other gasket hardnesses or pressure relief settings are appropriate depending on the circumstances and design considerations.In this embodiment,gasket400comprises at least two portions or compartments, generally circular first compartment orbrewing valve portion402and second compartment or pressure regulator/safety valve404. In at least one embodiment, brewingvalve portion402controls the flow of the brewed liquid.In the illustrated embodiment, generally circularbrewing valve portion402has asurface406andouter rim408defining slit409(best viewed inFIG. 6).Surface406defines two stages or openings that open in sequence. The first or primary opening410(centrally located in brewingvalve portion402and adapted to removably receive upper mounting post306) meters the flow of the brewed liquid, slowing down the liquid flow. Slowing down the liquid flow enables the liquid to more completely extract the flavor from the particulate brewing substance (coffee for example).Opening410is normally in a closed position, but opens upon sufficient pressure build up. During the normal brewing process, the portion of thegasket400near the upper mountingpost306deflects upward when the pressure within the filter/pod compartment24reaches a sufficient level (about four or five psi). This enables the pressurized fluid and steam to flow from the filter/pod compartment24into thefiltrate passage32.The second orsecondary opening412is, in one embodiment, placed proximate tofirst opening410. In one embodiment, thesecond opening412is offset from thefirst opening410in the center ofgasket400and comprises one ormore slits414. In at least one embodiment, slits414open under pressure to relive sudden surges due to, for example, a concentration of microwave energy or a shift in the filtrate medium.Secondary opening412prevents the chocking of thefirst opening410due to a sudden pressure build-up.The second compartment or pressure regulator/safety valve portion404comprises a pressure regulator. In one embodiment, the pressure regulator/safety valve portion404comprises anelongated portion415having a tab416(best viewed inFIG. 1) and pressure regulator/safety/bypass valve418(best viewed inFIG. 7). In at least one embodiment,tab416provides support to rubber elongatedportion415, makingportion415rigid so it will not collapse under pressure and compromise the seal.In at least one embodiment, the pressure regulator/safety/bypass valve418comprises one ormore slits420and acts a safety valve. In at least one embodiment, the one ormore slits420are normally in a closed position but open under pressure to relieve sudden surges due to, for example, a concentration of microwave energy, a shift in the filtrate medium or a blockage in the normal water/steam passage. The pressure regulator/safety/bypass valve418is, in one embodiment, placed directly over thereservoir28and fluidly communicates with at leastfiltrate passage32, acting as a bypass route in case the particulate brewing substance offers too much resistance to the flow of liquid under pressure (if the filter medium, coffee for example, is ground too fine).It is contemplated that, as a pressure regulator, the pressure regulator/safety/bypass valve418determines the maximum pressure allowed in thewater reservoir28. Changing the controlled pressure (modifying the slit pattern of the pressure regulator/safety/bypass valve418for example), modifies the extraction strength of the brewed liquid and determines the flavor of hot beverage.Referring now toFIGS. 8,9and10, there is generally shown another embodiment of a microwave beverage maker, designated800.Beverage maker800generally includes anupper cup assembly812, abottom assembly1200, ahandle814and liquid orwater reservoir838. It is contemplated thatbeverage maker800further includes afiltrate splash cover2400and deflector2800(seeFIG. 11for example). In at least one embodiment, thebeverage maker800may again be generally constructed of a plastic microwave-transparent, pressure-resistant, dishwasher safe material (for example, polypropylene, PET® polyethylene terephthalate, polyester, ULTEM® polyether imide, polysulphane, or ULTEM® LTX Series polyether imide-polycarbonate blend) suitable for use with both hot and cold beverages and both microwave and dishwasher safe.In at least one embodiment, theupper cup assembly812includes a generally cup-like filtrate reservoir816which is adapted to receive a liner or shield3100(a thin cup comprised of aluminum or other suitable microwave reflective material for example) and a first or upper water orliquid reservoir839. Liner3100(best viewed inFIGS. 11,31and32) is generally locked in place and shields any beverage contained therein from microwave energy, preventing the beverage from being overheated.FIG. 11further illustratesbottom assembly1200which, in one embodiment, comprises gasket valve orgasket2100, filter/pod compartment818andbottom cover1202forming second or lower liquid orwater reservoir1204.Bottom cover1202includes areceptacle1206and pin1208(best viewed inFIG. 12) for receiving a filter/pod compartment818; where filter/pod compartment818is adapted to hold coffee grounds, tea, espresso or other particulate brewing substance either free or in a pod as provided below. The general shape of the components, as well as whether the components are integrally molded together or are multiple affixed pieces, are matters of design choice.Bottom cover1202may have a convexouter surface1210and/or one ormore fins1212to improve stability of thebeverage maker800when placed on a surface. In one embodiment,outer surface1210may include a star-shaped rib (not shown) used to improve stability.FIGS. 12,13and14illustrate an embodiment ofbottom cover1202includingreceptacle1206positioned (centrally for example) inreservoir1204, wherereceptacle1206is adapted to receive the filter/pod compartment818first orlower pod holder1500for example). In at least one embodiment,receptacle1206is adapted to receive the filter/pod compartment818, or at least a portion thereof, in a removable manner, a rotatable manner or both. Reservoir838(upper and/orlower reservoirs839and1204) may include one or more marks (high gauge marks for example not shown) used in indicating the water levels needed in making different heated beverages (coffee, espresso and double espresso for example).Furthermore, in at least one embodiment,upper cup assembly812defines at least onefiltrate passage820having at least one opening, for fluidly conducting steam and liquid (water for example) from at least the filter/pod compartment818to at least the filtrate reservoir816(best viewed inFIG. 11).Filtrate passage820is formed by passageinterior surface830,passage side walls832, and passage backwall834integrally molded within a portion of theupper cup assembly812. In the illustrated embodiment,upper cup assembly812defines the at least onefiltrate passage820having two openings, first andsecond openings822and826, wherefirst opening822fluidly communicates with water reservoir838(lower reservoir1204for example) whilesecond opening826fluidly communicates with at leastfiltrate reservoir816.Thebottom cover1202including second orlower reservoir1204releasably engages theupper cup assembly812atconnection828. It should be appreciated that any known releasable attachment mechanism is contemplated (reciprocal square threads are depicted). Such releasable engagement removably positions the filter/pod compartment818andgasket2100between thereservoir1204andupper cup assembly812, such that thefirst opening822of thefiltrate passage820fluidly engages at least an upper portion ofgasket2100, enabling steam or liquid (water for example) to pass from the water reservoir838(upper and/orlower reservoirs839and1204for example) through the filter/pod compartment818(entering through the bottom thereof) into at least thefiltrate reservoir816.It should further be appreciated that, whilebottom cover1202andreceptacle1206are illustrated, any alternative configuration or structure to hold or align the filter/pod compartment818in place are contemplated.FIGS. 15–20depict an embodiment of a filter/pod compartment818. The filter/pod compartment818may be fixed or self-contained and removable. At least one embodiment comprises first or lower and second orupper pod holders1500and1800, however other embodiments comprise first andsecond pod holders1500and1800and filter shield3300(best viewed inFIGS. 33–36), wherein at least one of the first orlower pod holder1500, second orupper pod holder1800and thefilter shield3300may be removed from thebottom assembly1200.In the illustrated embodiment, filter/pod compartment818, comprising first or lower and second orupper pod holders1500and1800respectively, sits inreceptacle1206in a removable and/or rotatable manner using centrally located, downwardly extendingpin receptacle1502adapted to receivepin1208.Pin1208is received bypin receptacle1502in a removable and/or rotatable manner, wherepin receptacle1502has an inner diameter approximately equal or slightly greater than the outer diameter ofpin1208, enabling the first orlower pod holder1500to rotate inreceptacle1206. Referring toFIGS. 15–17, the first orlower pod holder1500has a generally conical appearance (best view inFIG. 17), whereinlower portion1504of the first or lower pod holder has an inside diameter smaller than an inside diameter ofupper portion1506. It should be appreciated that, although a generally conical first orlower pod holder1500is depicted, other shapes are contemplated.In at least one embodiment, first orlower pod holder1500comprises afilter wall1508having inner andouter surfaces1510and1512. At least one, but generally a plurality ofsupport ribs1514are coupled to and extend frominner surface1510towardspin receptacle1502in a spaced radial relationship. At least one of the plurality of support ribs1514(a first set ofsupport ribs1516for example) is coupled to bothinner surface1510andpin receptacle1502and extends there between, while one other of the plurality of support ribs1514(a second and/or third set ofsupport ribs1518and1520for example) is coupled to theinner surface1510and extends only partway towards thepin receptacle1502.Filter wall1508defines an annular ring oredge1522at one end thereof (proximateupper portion1506for example). This annular ring oredge1522interlocks with the second orupper pod holder1800.The first orlower pod holder1500defines one ormore sections1524. In at least one embodiment, at least one of thesections1524are defined by at least one ormore support ribs1514,pin receptacle1502andinner surface1510. Thesections1524are in fluid communication with at least thelower reservoir1204and are adapted to receive liquid placed therein. It is contemplated that, after application of microwave energy (i.e., completion of the brew cycle) liquid or water may remain in the liquid or water reservoir, which is to be minimized.Support ribs1514, alone or in some combination withpin receptacle1502and/orinner surface1510, limit the amount of space in the first orlower pod holder1500available for the liquid or water, decreasing the amount of water in transition. In this manner, much less liquid is left behind in the filter/pod compartment818during the application of microwave energy (i.e., the brewing process), so that only a small amount of liquid remains in thewater reservoir1204.It should further be appreciated that thebeverage maker800may accept pods of different sizes containing filtrate as provided below. Therefore, the filter/pod compartment818should be able to accommodate pods of different sizes without shredding the pod filter or membrane and, at the same time, preventing the liquid from going around the pod (i.e., all or almost all of the liquid should flow through the filter/pod compartment818and pod).FIGS. 18–20depict second orupper pod holder1800that removably positioned in pod guide or guide wall1801(illustrated inFIG. 11) and sits on or engages the first orlower pod holder1500during the brewing process. Second orupper pod holder1800comprises first andsecond surfaces1808and1810respectively (first and second recessed or concave surfaces for example), wheresecond surface1810is a mirror image offirst surface1808, such that either surface may engage the first orlower pod holder1500and thegasket2100during the assembly and brewing process.In at least one embodiment, second orupper pod holder1800comprises one ormore support ribs1802extending between (or partway between)support post1806and one or more outer support rings1804in a spaced radial relationship. Outer support rings1804define at least oneannular ring1812on both sides thereof.Support ring1804engages and interlocks with at least the first or lower pod holder1500(engagingannular ring1522for example), enabling the second orupper pod holder1500to seal. As provided previously, thebeverage maker800accommodates pods of different sizes, and in order to work with both large and small sized pods, theupper pod holder1800usesannular ring1812that engages the different sized pods at a critical diameter so that liquid doesn't bypass the different sized pod, but goes through the pod. As provided previously, thelower pod holder1800is rotatable aboutpin1208, so that the when thelower holder1800engages theupper pod holder1500,bottom cover1202can rotate (to engage the threads atconnection828for example) without shredding the differing sized pods.FIGS. 18 and 19further illustrate that the second orupper pod holder1800defines a plurality of openings orperforations1814of a size and number sufficient to retain the particulate brewing substance, while allowing the passage of steam and liquid.Referring now toFIGS. 21–23, one embodiment of gasket orvalve2100is illustrated. The gasket orvalve2100is made of any suitable resilient material transparent to microwave energy (food grade silicon rubber for example) and is adapted to removably fit within predetermined space in the beverage maker800(between a top surface of second orupper pod holder1800and the lower surface ofupper cup assembly812for example). In at least one embodiment,gasket2100comprises material having a hardness of approximately 60 durometer. Other material hardness or pressure relief settings are appropriate depending on the circumstances and design considerations.In this embodiment,gasket valve2100comprises at least two portions or compartments, generally circular first orbrewing valve portion2102and second compartment or pressure regulator/safety valve2104(best viewed inFIGS. 21 and 22). In at least one embodiment,gasket2100is adaptable, controlling the flow of the brewed liquid and/or regulates pressure, preventing accidents.In the illustrated embodiment, generally circularbrewing valve portions2102has first andsecond surfaces2106and2108(recessed or concave surfaces for example), wheresecond surface2108is a mirror image offirst surface2106, andouter rim2110.Surfaces2106and2108define at least one stage or opening2112(centrally located in brewingvalve portion2102for example) that acts as a meter valve, metering the flow of the brewed liquid, slowing down the liquid flow as it passes through at least the particulate brewing substance. Slowing down the liquid flow enables the liquid to more completely extract the flavor from the particulate brewing substance (coffee or tea for example). During the normal brewing process, the portion of thegasket2100deflects upward when the pressure within the filter/pod compartment818reaches a predetermined level (four or five psi for example). This enables the pressurized fluid and steam to flow from the filter/pod compartment818into thefiltrate passage820, through the bottom of thelower pod holder1500.In at least one embodiment,gasket2100includes aslit2116defined inouter rim2110. In oneembodiment slit2116, is adapted to engage an outside surface and/orannular ring1812of the second orupper pod holder1800, confining movement of thebrewing valve portion2102, producing a seal.The second or pressure regulator/safety valve2104comprises a pressure regulator. In one embodiment, the pressure regulator/safety valve2104comprises an elongated portion having a tab2118(best viewed inFIGS. 21 and 23) and bypass valve2120(best viewed inFIG. 21).Tab2118engages a ledge of the filter/pod compartment818and acts to confine movement of thebrewing valve portion2102.In at least one embodiment, the pressure regulator/safety valve2104comprises one ormore slits2122and acts a safety or over pressure valve. The one ormore slits2122are normally in a closed position but open under pressure to relieve sudden surges due to, for example, a concentration of microwave energy or a blockage of the regular passage through the coffee pod (i.e., the pressure regulator/safety valve2104adapts to the pressure change). The pressure regulator/safety valve2104is, in one embodiment, placed directly over thereservoir1204and fluidly communicates with at leastfiltrate passage820and is adaptable, acting as a bypass route in case the particulate brewing substance offers too much resistance to the flow of liquid under pressure (if the filter medium, coffee for example, is ground too fine).It is contemplated that, as a pressure regulator, the pressure regulator/safety valve2104determines the maximum pressure allowed in thewater reservoir1204. Changing the controlled pressure (modifying the slit pattern of the pressure regulator/safety valve2104for example), modifies the extraction strength of the brewed liquid and determines the flavor of hot beverage.At least one embodiment of themicrowave beverage maker800includes afiltrate splash cover2400, best viewed inFIGS. 24–26, which acts as a splash guard, adapted to prevent eruption and spill over, and break down bubbles, during the brewing process (i.e., upon the application of microwave energy). Thefiltrate splash cover2400acts as a splash guard, breaks down bubbles, and provides for venting. In an exemplary embodiment,filtrate splash cover2400has a generally rounded appearance when viewed from the top (best illustrated inFIG. 24) and a slightly convex appearance when viewed from the side (best illustrated inFIG. 25). Thefiltrate splash cover2400is formed to removably contact the top edge of themicrowave beverage maker800. As illustrated, thefiltrate splash cover2400has a rounded top portion that defines a vent or hole2402(a center vent or hole) used to vent steam during and after the brewing process and adetent2404adapted to contact thedeflector800.FIGS. 25 and 26further depict a dependingwall2406extending from an inner surface2408(extending into thebeverage maker800for example), running substantially around the circumference of thecover2400, and adapted to engage the top edge of thebeverage maker800in a friction fit.Cover2400further includes at least onesupport rib2410that extends from theinner surface2408of the cover2400(inwardly into thebeverage maker800for example). In the illustrated embodiment, thesupport rib2410runs around thehole2402and has a star-like pattern (although other arrangements or patterns are contemplated.FIG. 27depicts ahandle cover2700used with amicrowavable beverage maker800similar to that ofFIGS. 8 and 9. In at least one embodiment, thehandle cover2700has a general U shape when viewed from the side. Thehandle cover2700is adapted to be removably or fixedly attached to thehandle814of themicrowavable beverage maker800. In at least one embodiment, thehandle cover2700is made of the same or different material as themicrowavable beverage maker800. As a separate entity, handlecover2700may provide a textured surface for grip and accent color.It should be appreciated that the user may forget to use thefiltrate splash cover2400during the brewing process (i.e., upon the application of microwave energy), which may result spill over into the microwave oven. Further, it is possible that the user might scald themselves if they try to drink the filtrate immediately upon removal from the microwave oven. At least one embodiment contemplates a deflector, depicted inFIGS. 28–30and generally designated2800, adapted to reduce or prevent spillover and scalding.As depicted,deflector2800comprises deflection and affixingportions2802and2804respectively, joined or connected by connectingportion2806. In at least one embodiment,deflection portion2802comprises a lip2808(a rounded lip is shown, but other shapes are contemplated) extending outward or away from connectingportion2806. The connectingportion2806as shown is formed so that it is both curved and rounded to accommodate both the top edge and curvature of thebeverage maker800in either a secured or removable fashion.Referring toFIG. 29, one embodiment of the affixingportion2804ofdeflector800is illustrated. In this exemplary embodiment, affixingportion2804has a horseshoe like appearance and is adapted to contact at least a portion of the handle in a secured or removable fashion. Theconnection portion2806has connectingportion2810and at least one but generally twotimes2812that extend from connectingportion2810. The affixingportion2804as shown is formed so that it is both curved and rounded to accommodate both the curvature of thebeverage maker800and thehandle814in either a secured or removable fashion. In one exemplary embodiment,deflector2800is adapted to clip to thehandle814.It is contemplated that a user may dial a longer cycle than necessary to brew the liquid. This may result in overheating the liquid or filtrate.FIGS. 31 and 32depict an embodiment of a liner orshield3100. As illustrated,liner3100is generally cylindrical and formed bywall3102andsurface3104. In at least one embodiment,liner3100may be comprised of aluminum, other metallic substance or microwave reflective materials (not shown) to shield the brewed liquid from the microwave energy and control any overheating of the brewed coffee or espresso that would spoil the flavor.FIGS. 33–36depict an embodiment of theshield3300that may be used with the filter/pod compartment818(first orlower pod holder1500for example) as provided above. One purpose ofshield3300is to prevent overheating of the coffee medium or pod in the eventuality the user forgets to put liquid inreservoir838but puts the machine in the microwave oven. In at least one embodiment,shield3300is adapted to fixedly or removable engage a portion of the filter/pod compartment818(either the first orlower pod holder1500, the second orupper pod holder1800or both.Shield3300comprises surface3302(a depressed or concave surface for example) connected towall3304. In at least one embodiment,shield3300further compriseslip3306withwall3308extending there from.FIGS. 34 and 35illustrate that theshield3300has a plurality of openings orperforations3310of a size and number sufficient to retain the particulate brewing substance, while allowing passage of steam and liquid.FIGS. 34 and 35further illustrate that the shield defines a plurality of openings orperforations3310of a size and number sufficient to retain the particulate brewing substance, while allowing the passage of steam and liquid. The size of theopenings3310may range from about 0.020 to about 0.040 inches in diameter; although other sizes may be suitable depending on the size of the particulate brewing substance.It should be appreciated that the microwaves have recognized physical characteristics. In RF energy applications, there is a direct relationship between the frequency (cycles per second or Hz) and the wavelength (physical size of the wave): the higher the frequency, the proportionately shorter the wavelength; and, the lower the frequency, the proportionately longer the wavelength. The small holes in the shield allow liquid to pass through. On the other hand, microwaves are low in frequency, thus they have a longer wavelength (at 2450 MHz, about 4 ¾ inches, in fact). Therefore, microwaves are simply too large to pass through the small holes in the shield. To the microwaves, thesesmall perforations3310actually represent a solid metal wall that effectively blocks or reflects the microwaves back in the opposite direction.One embodiment of the present invention uses filtrate pods (not shown) instead of loose particulate brewing substance (coffee for example) in the filtrate compartments818. In one embodiment, the filtrate pod or pod comprises a disc or central area containing the particulate brewing substance. The particulate brewing substance (coffee for example) is trapped between two sheets of filter paper secured together (glued around a rim or edge for example). In at least one embodiment, the pod has a diameter greater than 25 mm but less than 80 mm, generally between about 50 mm to about 75 mm in diameter. One exemplary embodiment has a diameter of about 72 mm, while the central area (containing the particulate brewing substance) has a diameter of about 60 mm and is about 10 mm thick. Another exemplary embodiment has a diameter of about 60 mm, while the diameter of the central area is about 48 mm and is about 12 mm thick. The central area generally protrudes equally on either side of the secured or glue area that is paper-thin. In at least one embodiment, the pods are individually sealed in a Poly square bag about 93 mm square. However, it is contemplated that any commercially available filtrate pods, having different dimensions than those describe previously, may be used.To operate, ground coffee, tea, or other espresso particulate brewing substance, either loose, in a porous block form, contained in a paper bag or other filter, or in a filtrate pod as provided above, is placed within the filter/pod compartment818. Thelower pod holder1500is connected or attached to the edge of the upper pod holder1800(which is positioned within pod guide or pod wall1801). The lower pod holder is, in at least one embodiment, positioned within thereceptacle1206of thewater reservoir1204such that the filter/pod compartment818is located generally in the flow path between thefiltrate passage820andreservoir838. A suitable quantity of water is poured into thereservoir838, and the annular end of thecircular bottom assembly1200is removably connected to theupper cup assembly812atconnection828. Thegasket2100forms a substantial seal or seat between thefiltrate passage820and the filter/pod compartment818, where, in at least one embodiment, thegasket2100substantially closes the path for passage of liquid and steam from the filter/pod compartment818to thefiltrate passage820.Upon application of the microwave energy, the liquid (water for example) in thereservoir838heats up, vapor forms, and the pressure increases. When the pressure within the filter/pod compartment818reaches a predetermined level (approximately 5 psi for example). The steam pressure forces hot liquid and steam to rise upwards through the filter/pod compartment818, the particulate brewing substance, the gasket central hole, thefiltrate passage820and into thefiltrate reservoir816. In at least one embodiment afiltrate splash cover2400is removably connected to an upper portion ofupper cup assembly812. Thefiltrate splash cover2400serves to break up bubbles and contain steam within thefiltrate reservoir816, where it may cool and condense, while the deflector deflects liquid into thefiltrate reservoir816. Thefiltrate splash cover2400thereby limits the undesired escape of fluid and steam into the microwave oven. The process continues until most of the water has been discharged into thefiltrate reservoir816. Espresso may be brewed in approximately two to three minutes, depending upon the power of the oven, the quantity of espresso being brewed, and the atmosphere conditions.While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from its scope. For example, multiple piece components may be utilized in lieu of an integrally molded assembly. Alternate types of filter splash covers can be used. Different shapes and configurations of the filter/pod compartment, filters, water reservoir, water reservoir receptacle, filtrate passage, filtrate reservoir, bottom cover, and handle may be used as a matter of design choice to practice the present invention.

       "  'description': 'BEVERAGE MACHINE FOR SHORT AND TALL CUPS Field of the InventionThe field of the invention pertains to beverage dispensing machines configured for tall cups and having a support arrangement for short cups.Background ArtCertain beverage preparation machines use capsules containing ingredients to be extracted or to be dissolved; for other machines, the ingredients are stored and dosed automatically in the machine or else are added at the time of preparation of the drink.Most beverage machines possess within a housing: filling means that include a pump for liquid, usually water, which pumps the liquid from a source of water that is cold or indeed heated through heating means, such as a heating resistor, a thermoblock or the like, a brewing unit in which an ingredient is brewed with water or a mixing unit in which ingredients are mixed together, and a beverage outlet for dispensing the prepared beverage. Typically, the beverage outlet is located above a grid for supporting a cup or other recipient under the outlet and for the passage of possible drips from the beverage outlet or other spills into a collector tray located under the grid.For example, EP 1 440 639 discloses a beverage machine comprising a receptacle stand having a hollow interior forming a drip tray. An upper surface of the receptacle stand is provided with a grill on which the receptacle is positioned. The drip tray is removable from the housing to ease emptying of the collected water.Drip tray devices with cup supports are well known in the art. There are also such devices that are further arranged for allowing the adjustment of the vertical position under the beverage outlet of cups of different sizes. For instance, EP 0 549 887 and US 5,161,455 disclose devices with an adjustable cup support for small and large receptacles. Further exemplary cup supports are disclosed in DE9109023, DE29810291 and EP2342997. US 5,353,692 discloses a beverage vending machine having a cup station with an upper beverage outlet and a bottom drain-gate on a drip collector. Above the drain gate, the cup station has a retractable support member for positioning small cups under the beverage outlet. This cup station is formed as a grid for allowing the passage of drips down to the drain-gate. EP 1 731 065 discloses a beverage machine that has a drip tray device located under a beverage outlet. This device has a first support grid for a first beverage recipient covering a drip tray or collection tank. The first support grid is removable form the drip tray to give access to a second support thereunder for supporting a larger cup under the outlet. Moreover, the drip tray supports a receptacle for used capsules and can be removed en bloc with the cup support arrangement from the machine for emptying the capsule receptacle and the drip tray. EP 1 867 260 discloses a drip tray with a cup support that is movably mounted, generally at mid-height, onto a beverage machine. The cup support has an operative horizontally extending position for positioning a small cup under the machine\\'s beverage outlet and can be pivoted upwards against the machine\\'s main body or otherwise moved so as to give sufficient space for positioning a large cup under the beverage outlet on a support surface located below this above movable cup support. Cup supports of the same are disclosed in WO2011/154492 and W02012/007313.Likewise, WO 2009/074557 discloses a beverage preparation machine with a cup support and drip tray device located under a machine\\'s beverage outlet. The device has a drip tray arrangement for evacuating liquid and for supporting a cup below the outlet and has an extension for hygienically supporting cups upon use.In WO 2009/074559, a similar beverage machine is disclosed in which the cup support and drip tray device has a reservoir for collecting ingredient capsules upon use. The device includes an arrangement for unjamming the system when the reservoir is so over-filled with used capsules as to interfere with the structure of the machine and to prevent removal of the device with the over-filled receptacle. WO 2010/031665 discloses a beverage preparation machine with a separable semi-cocoon-shaped device for receiving a cup support device of complementary shape, the cup support device having a liquid permeable surface and a liquid collector therebelow. The cup support device has a connector for disconnectably connecting it at two different heights in the receiving device above an inner bottom face of the receiving device, the inner bottom face extending under substantially the entire cup support device. The presence of the cup support device displaceable vertically in the receiving device prevents a premature soling of the inner surfaces of the receiving device. It follows that the receiving device is not designed or intended for use without the cup support device. The receiving device can be removed from the machine and the cup support device can be removed from the receiving device for servicing, e.g. cleaning, and/or for an exchange of these devices by similar devices of different designs.Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.Summary of the InventionThe invention thus relates to machines for dispensing a beverage from a beverage outlet to cups of different sizes, in particular to short cups, e.g. espresso cups, and tall cups such as mugs, e.g. cappuccino cups.According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a beverage preparation machine comprising: a beverage preparation module with a bottom and a heightening device for heightening a short cup under a beverage outlet of the beverage preparation module that is arranged to dispense beverage into a tall cup, which device comprises: a bottom for resting on a support surface; a platform that is supported by the bottom and that is configured for receiving said short cup and heightening thereof over the bottom; and a means for assembling the bottom and the platform as a unit to an assembling means of said module under said outlet, wherein the assembling means of such device and of said module are disassemblable for separating the unit from said module and removing the unit from under said outlet, wherein the heightening device bottom and the module bottom are both arranged to rest on the same support surface and to be supported thereby during use; and the removing of the unit from under said outlet allows placement of said tall cup on said support surface under said outlet.Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words \"comprise\", \"comprising\", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of \"including, but not limited to\".For the purpose of the present description, a \"beverage\" is meant to include any human-consumable liquid substance, such as tea, coffee, hot or cold chocolate, milk, soup, baby food, etc... A \"capsule\" is meant to include any pre-portioned beverage ingredient, such as a flavouring ingredient, within an enclosing packaging of any material, in particular an airtight packaging, e.g. plastic, aluminium, recyclable and/or biodegradable packagings, and of any shape and structure, including soft pods or rigid cartridges containing the ingredient. The capsule may contain an amount of ingredient for preparing a single beverage serving or a plurality of beverage servings.The beverage preparation machine can be an in-home or out of home machine. The machine may be a coffee, tea, chocolate, cacao, milk, soup, baby food, etc... preparation machine. The machine may be arranged for preparing within a beverage processing module a beverage by passing hot or cold water or another liquid through a capsule containing an ingredient, such as a flavouring ingredient, of the beverage to be prepared, such as ground coffee or tea or chocolate or cacao or milk powder.The beverage preparation typically includes the mixing of a plurality of beverage ingredients, e.g. water and milk powder, and/or the infusion of a beverage ingredient, such as an infusion of ground coffee or tea with water. One or more of such ingredients may be supplied in loose and/or agglomerate powder form and/or in liquid form, in particular in a concentrate form. A carrier or diluents liquid, e.g. water, may be mixed with such ingredient to form the beverage.For instance, a predetermined amount of beverage is formed and dispensed on user-request, which corresponds to a serving. The volume of such a serving may be in the range of 25 to 200 ml and even up to 300 or 400 ml, e.g. the volume for filling a cup, depending on the type of beverage. Formed and dispensed beverages may be selected from ristrettos, espressos, lungos, cappuccinos, LatteMacchiato, cafe latte, americano coffees, teas, etc... In particular, a coffee machine may be configured for dispensing espressos, e.g. an adjustable volume of 20 to 60 ml per serving, and/or for dispensing lungos, e.g. a volume in the range of 70 to 150 ml per serving.According to a particular aspect, the invention relates to a heightening device for heightening a short cup under a beverage outlet of a beverage preparation module that is arranged to dispense a beverage into a tall cup.The placement surface for such a tall cup and for the heightening device under the beverage outlet can be a surface external to the machine, e.g. the surface of a table on which the beverage preparation module is placed. Alternatively, the beverage preparation module may include under its beverage outlet a foot on which either a tall cup or the heightening device can be placed.The heightening device of the invention comprises: a bottom for resting on a support surface, in particular a support surface external to the module or part of the module; a platform that is supported by the bottom and that is configured for receiving the short cup and heightening thereof over the bottom; and a means for assembling the bottom and the platform as a unit to a corresponding assembling means of such beverage preparation module under such outlet.In accordance with the invention, the assembling means of the heightening device and of such beverage preparation module are disassemblable for separating the unit from the module and removing the unit from under said beverage outlet to allow placement of the tall cup on the support surface under the beverage outlet.Hence, the heightening device is provided as a support for a short cup to raise such short cup under a beverage outlet of a beverage preparation module that is positioned at height for delivering a beverage into a tall cup. When a tall cup is used, the heightening device can be separated from the beverage preparation module and moved away to leave a free spot to place the tall cup under the beverage outlet.Typically, the heightening device has a generally upright wall for spacing the platform over the bottom. The sidewall may be connected to the bottom and form therewith a receptacle having a cavity for collecting liquid. The platform may be made removable from the device to access the receptacle, for instance for emptying the receptacle. The assembling means of the heightening device can be mounted to or comprised in or formed by the upright wall.Typically, the platform comprise an arrangement for draining liquid through the platform, in particular a grid-like arrangement.Any assembling means is contemplated, e.g. snap or hook or bayonet assembly means.In an embodiment of the invention, the device assembling means comprises: a magnet element that is arranged to be magnetically constrained against a corresponding ferromagnetic element of said module assembling means; and/or a ferromagnetic element that is arranged to be magnetically constrained against a corresponding magnet of said module assembling means.Optionally, such device comprises a support member, such as a generally upright sidewall, supporting the magnetic or ferromagnetic device element, which element has an apparent face for cooperating with and facing the module assembling means, such apparent face being recessed in the support member or protruding out therefrom.Such a magnet element generates a magnetic field. A suitable magnet element may be a permanent magnet, e.g. made of iron, nickel, cobalt, rare earth metals, e.g. lanthanide, and alloys and oxides containing such metals as well as polymers (e.g. plastics) carrying such elements and components. It is also possible to use an electromagnet as a magnet element. A suitable ferromagnetic element may be made of at least one of Co, Fe, Fe203, Fe0Fe203, Ni0Fe203, Cu0Fe203,MgO Fe2<C3, Nd2Fei4B, Mn, Bi, Ni, MnSb, Mn0Fe203, Y3Fe50i2, Cr02, MnAs, Gd, Dy, EuO, Cu2MnAl, Cu2MnIn, Cu2MnSn, Ni2MnAl, Ni2MnIn, Ni2MnSn, Ni2MnSb, Ni2MnGa, Co2MnAl, Co2MnSi, Co2MnGa, Co2MnGe, SmCos, Sm2Coi7, Pd2MnAl, Pd2MnIn, Pd2MnSn, Pd2MnSb, Co2FeSi, FesSi, Fe2VAl, Mn2VGa and Co2FeGe.The magnet and/or the ferromagnetic element of the device assembling means can be mounted in a hole, such as a through-hole or a blind hole, optionally force-fitted or glued or screwed in such a hole, of a nonferromagnetic element such as a non-ferromagnetic or magnetically indifferent wall or support element. Other assembly and connection methods are of course possible.Another aspect of the invention relates beverage preparation machine that comprises: a beverage preparation module having a beverage outlet; and a heightening device as described above. The module has a module assembling means under the outlet for disassemblable assembly to the device assembling means.In a particular embodiment of the invention, the module comprises further module assembling means for disassemblable assembly of the device assembling means. Such further modules assembling means are so located that when the device assembling means are assembled thereto the unit of the device is located away from under beverage outlet.Hence, such further module assembling means can be used to secure the heightening device in a rest position, i.e. when not in use under the machine\\'s beverage outlet.The beverage outlet and the module assembling means can be located on a first face of the machine. The further module assembling means may be located on one more second faces of the machine. Optionally, the first face forms a machine front face and the second face(s) form(s) at least one of a machine side face and a machine rear face.The module can have a cavity for receiving a service device bearing at least one of: the module assembling means and the further module assembling means. in particular a service device for supplying a consumable substance and/or for collecting a used or waste substance .Typically, the service device is configured for collecting at least one of: one or more waste beverage ingredients, such as a used flavouring ingredient and/or waste water; one or more used capsules for supplying a beverage ingredient into beverage preparation module; and a cleaning agent, such as a cleaning, rinsing or descaling liquid. A suitable service device may be configured for storing a supply of the abovementioned beverage ingredients and/or capsules before use or a supply of the abovementioned cleaning agent before use.For instance, the service device comprises at least one of: a drawer configuration for being slidable into and out of the module; a handle for manually moving the service device in an out of the module; and a first receptacle for containing a first substance and a second receptacle for containing a second substance, such as a lower receptacle and an upper receptacle, in particular a lower receptacle for containing liquid and an upper receptacle for containing a solid.The service device may include a handle that forms at the same time the module assembly means or part thereof or a support for the module assembly means.When the service device is movable, in particular slidable in and out of the module, it can be secured in the beverage preparation module to resist disassembly of the assembling means of the beverage preparation module and the heightening device assembling means.For example, the service device may be secured in the module\\'s cavity by a snap or a magnetic connector or another assembling means that is stronger than the connection force of the assembled assembling means of the heightening device and corresponding assembling means of the module. Hence, when the assembly means of the module, i.e. part of the service device, and of the heightening device are separated, the service device stays in place in the cavity of the module.The module typically has a bottom. The heightening device bottom and the module bottom may be both arranged to rest on a same support surface and to be supported thereby during use. The bottoms resting on the support surface are in particular adjacent to each other during use. Such a support surface for the bottoms can be a kitchen or dining table or any generally stable and horizontal surface that is able to support the weight of the beverage preparation machine.The module and the heightening device can be magnetically cοnstrainab1e together by the module assembling means and the (heightening) device assembling means .The device assembling means can have a magnetic field-generating element and the module assembling means may have a ferromagnetic element and/or vice versa. Typically during use (e.g. under the beverage outlet) or rest (e.g. stored against the beverage module away from the use position) of the heightening device, the fieldgenerating element of the device can have an average magnetic field axis that is off-set above an average magnetic field axis of the module so that the heightening device is urged downwards by the module.In one embodiment, the device comprises a device support member, such as a generally upright wall, and the module comprises a module support member, such as a wall of a module housing or of a service device. The device support member supports a device element and the module support member supports a module element. These device and module elements form the module and device assembling means and are magnetically constrainable together. When the device element and the module element are magnetically constrained together: the device element, in particular an apparent face thereof, is recessed in an recess of the device support member and the module element, in particular an apparent face thereof, protrudes away from the module support member so that the module element, in particular the apparent module face, extends into the device recess, in particular to or towards the apparent device face; or the device element, in particular an apparent face thereof, protrudes away from the device support member and the module element, in particular an apparent face thereof, is recessed in a recess of the module support member so that the device element, in particular the apparent device face, extends into the module recess, in particular to or towards the apparent module face.In the context of the present disclosure, the relative orientation of the machine, e.g. references to the machine\\'s top, front, bottom, side, rear, etc., unless specified otherwise, typically relate to the orientation of operation of the machine, e.g. on top of a table, with the machine in front of a user for naturally operating the machine to dispense a beverage.Brief Description of the DrawingsThe invention will now be described with reference to the schematic drawings, wherein:Figure 1 is a perspective view of part of a heightening device according to the invention, the device being shown without its platform;Figs 2 and 3 are top and front views of the beverage preparation machine including the heightening device of Fig. 1; andFigs 3A and 3B are enlarged views of Details A and B indicated in Fig. 3Detailed descriptionFigures 1 to 3B illustrate particular embodiments of the present invention, in particular an embodiment of a heightening device 10 and an embodiment of a beverage preparation machine 1 formed of a beverage preparation module 2 cooperating with heightening device 10.Machine 1 can be electrically powered, typically by the mains, via an electric cord.Beverage preparation module 2 typically includes an internal circuit for circulating liquid, e.g. water, from reservoir or tank (not shown).

Invention Title: APPARATUS FOR MAKING BREWED COFFEE AND THE LIKE The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method for performing it known to me/us: APPARATUS FOR MAKING BREWED COFFEE AND THE LIKE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 5 1. Cross-Reference To Related Applications The following identified U.S. patent application is relied upon and incorporated by reference in this application: U.S. Patent Application No. 60/468,115, entitled \"Apparatus for Making Brewed Coffeee and the Like,\" bearing attorney docket no. 09741620-0402, and filed on May 2, 2003. 10 2. Technical Field. The invention relates to kitchen appliances generally and, in particular to an apparatus for brewing coffee. 3. Related Art. Coffee drinkers are often a picky lot. It is difficult to speak in terms of likes and dislikes 15 for the coffee consuming public. People in the coffee industry often look at the extraction rate for a particular combination of coffee variables (including blend, grind, moisture and roast color). \"Extraction rate\" is the amount of soluble solids that pass from coffee beans to brewed coffee and give it body and flavor. Coffee may be thin or \"underextracted,\" meaning that not enough soluble solids came out. Harshly potent coffee is referred to as \"overextracted,\" meaning 20 that too many soluble solids came out. The extraction rate also depends on the type of coffee maker used. Among other variables, the water temperature (the ideal water temperature is about 195 to 205 degrees F -- not a rolling boil, otherwise bitter substances will be extracted), water pressure, blend, the grind type, the filter type and the contact time between water and ground all figure into the extraction ]A rate. This may explain why there are so many different types of coffee makers, such as electric drip, moka, Napoletana, percolators, expresso and French presses. Drip coffee is the most common home-brewing method in which hot water drips through ground coffee at the force of gravity. Electric drip is the most common form of coffee maker. 5 \"Mokas\" use steam pressure (about 3.5 bars) from boiling water in a closed chamber to force the hot water to escape from the chamber and pass through ground coffee to produce coffee. Because of the steam temperatures, mokas tend to make bitter coffee. They also tend to require the brewing of multiple cups of coffee rather than a single cup. A \"napoletana\" has an lower chamber for boiling water and an upper chamber with a spout and in between a ground coffee 10 compartment. After water boils in the lower chamber, the pot is flipped over and the water drips through the ground coffee into the part with a spout. Napoletanas are messy and result in a strong cup of coffee. \"Percolators\" recycle boiling water through ground coffee filtered through a perforated metal or even a ceramic screen, producing a bitter, sour brew. \"French presses\" steep the coffee grounds in water, like tea leaves, then a finely perforated metal screen is pressed 15 down through the liquid to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee. This results in strong often bitter coffee taste profile. Espresso is a popular type of coffee. \"Espresso\" is a method of brewing coffee by forcing hot water at very high pressure (approximately 9 bars) through finely ground coffee, producing a syrupy texture and a powerful, sweet taste. Generally only a \"pump machine\" 20 produces true espresso at home. Pump machines have a small electric pump produce high pressure to force hot water through finely ground coffee. \"Steam machine\" which rely on pressure from built up steam in the fluid path --are also generally billed as espresso makers but may not produce sufficient pressure (9 bars) for true espresso. These very high pressure -2requirement make manufacturing espresso machines expensive. Larger pumps and reenforced fluid paths, boilers, etc. are required to ensure safety and reliability. However, espresso machines frequently allow users to make one or two small cups of espresso quickly with a pleasing strong taste and crema. \"Crema\" is the a golden foam made up of oil and colloids that 5 floats atop the surface of a perfectly brewed cup of espresso. Achieving crema depends on a number of factors, but most importantly the degree of pressure used in brewing. Some machines achieve sufficient pressure by mixing the coffee liquid with air after brewing by forcing it through a tiny opening.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 is an elevational, perspective view of a preferred embodiment of an apparatus for 15 brewing ground, brewable foodstuffs (such as coffee and tea). As shown, apparatus 100 has a water reservoir 102 to store water for brewing the ground foodstuffs, a brewhead 104 with a mechanical latch 106, and a pod holder assembly 110 that is capable of receiving a pod containing ground foodstuffs. The pod holder assembly 110 is supported by housing 112, which also preferrably contains, among other elements, a boiler, a flow meter, and a low pressure pump 20 all connected in a common fluid path between the water reservoir 102 and the pod holder assembly 110. The apparatus preferrably has a base 115 that may support up to two coffee cups 117. As would be readily understood, apparatus 100 may be used with vessels other than coffee cups. -4- The base may also include a drain cover and overflow reservoir to catch fluid not caught by coffee cup 117. A power switch 120 selectively connects the apparatus 100 to an electrical power supply, such as main power. As would be known to those skilled in the art, apparatus 100 will include one or more voltage regulator/transformers as needed to supply the appropriate 5 power to the various electrical components of the apparatus. As shown in FIG. 1, power switch 120 is preferrably implemented as momentary contact switch to facilitate \"auto shut-off\" functionality (in association with a controller (not shown)) as is common in household appliances today. As also shown in FIG. 1, switches 122 and 124 are preferrably provided to allow the end 10 user to select between two volumes (e.g. 5 ounces and 8 ounces) of brewed fluid to be produced. These two switches are operably connected to a first circuit that controls the metered fluid output of the flow meter based on this user selection. This first circuit primarily consists of a microprocessor or discrete circuit that monitors for the actuated one of switches 122 and 124 and controls the flow meter accordingly. While additional volume choices may be made available to 15 the end user, it is also possible that a single volume of brewed fluid may be permanently set by the manufacturer. In this manner, apparatus 100 produces a selected volume of brewed fluid as opposed to prior known apparatuses which control the brewing process using a timer. These timed-control apparatuses produce a widely variable amount of fluid due to the grind size, roast color, and the mass of the foodstuff, among other potential variables, in the pod. As a general 20 result, these variations in the timed-control apparatuses will unacceptably alter the taste profile of the resulting brewed fluid. FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the preferred fluid path of apparatus 100. This preferred fluid path includes flow meter 200, pump 202, boiler 204 and by-pass valve 206 - 5connected between the water reservoir 102 and pod holder assembly 110. It is contemplated that the order of flow meter 200, pump 202, and boiler 204 in the fluid path may be changed without departing from the scope of the present invention. Water reservoir 102 is in fluid communication with flow meter 200. Preferrably, the 5 water reservoir is constructed to contain approximately 28 ounces of water (essentially enough for 3, 8 oz cups or 5, 5 oz cups of brewed liquid). An optional valve 103 may be disposed on the water reservoir 102 such that water will not flow from the reservoir unless it is properly connected to the fluid path. This allows removal of the water reservoir 102 for refilling in a sink. Optional valve 103 is preferrably a mechanical valve that is biased closed upon removal from the 10 fluid path and remains open during fluid communication between the water reservoir 102 and the fluid path. Water reservoir 102 may additionally or alternatively have an open mouth to allow water to be poured into the reservoir without removing it from the rest of apparatus 100. Flow meter 200 is essentially a switch that controls the volume of water that is fed through the fluid path. In the preferred embodiment, flow meter 200 has a housing that encloses 15 a turbine with a magnet embedded therein. As water flows through the flow meter, the turbine rotates the magnet, which rotation is sensed by a hall effect sensor mounted in association with the flow meter housing. In this manner, a controller (not shown) can count the number of turns of the turbine. The number of turns corresponds to a volume of water flowed. Thus, once the turbine rotates a desired number of times, the desired volume of water has been flowed into the 20 fluid path. As discussed above, the controller may store more than one preset volume of water such that the end user can select the amount of brewed fluid produced by apparatus 100. Pump 202 is in fluid communication with both flow meter 200 and boiler 204. In one embodiment, pump 202 is an electric pump generating approximately 1.5 bars of pressure. In -6another embodiment, pump 202 generates approximately 3.5 bars of pressure. With 3,5 bars of pressure, it has been determined that apparatus 100 can produce acceptable crema from coffee pod 1100 (discussed below). It is contemplated that the fluid path, boiler, by-pass valve and flow meter of apparatus 100 can simply be built to accommodate this higher pressure allowing 5 the apparatus to use a pump having either pressure. Moreover because this higher pressure is much lower than the pressure required to produce espresso (generally thought to be approximately 9 bars), this 3.5 bar pressure requirement does not significantly raise the cost of the fluid path above that required to safely support 1.5 bars of pressure. This makes dual pressure this construction practical. It is contemplated that apparatus 100 could use a pump that can 10 produce both 1.5 and 3.5 bars of pressure. In such a case, a switch would be provided to select between these pressures. This switch could be made available only to the manufacturer or provided to the end user so as to allow selection of either pressure to achieve different taste profiles. Boiler 204 is in fluid communication with the pump 202 and by-pass valve 206. Boiler 15 204 preferrably has a volume of approximately 340 c.c. (or 12 ounces). Boiler 204 is electric and preferrably quickly heats the water to a desired preset temperature. While it is possible that boiler 204 could be a steam boiler, the use of steam would increase the water requirements of apparatus 100 along with its safety requirements (to protect against the steam pressures generated in such boilers) and, thus is considered to be generally undesirable. 20 By-pass valve 206 ensures that the pressure in the fluid path does not exceed the nominal pressure selected for apparatus 100. So, in an embodiment allowing for two pressures (e.g. approximately 1.5 and 3.5 bars), the by-pass valve would be selected to vent any pressure in the fluid path sufficiently in excess of 3.5 bars to cause safety and/or structural concerns. -7- Hot water from the fluid path flows out through a shower 300 in brewhead 104. As shown in FIG. 3, the shower 300 has a plurality of apertures through which the hot water flows down onto the top of the pod holder assembly 110 (shown in detail in FIG. 4). The brewhead 104 is hingedly connected to the housing 112 (FIG. 1) to allow the end user to remove pod 5 holder assembly I10 for placing a new pod with brewable foodstuff and for removing the assembly 110 for cleaning. Plastic bar 302 is biased upward, such that it is pushed downward as brewhead 104 is rotated down and forward into its closed position (shown in FIG. 1). In turn, plastic bar 302 moves a safety switch (not shown) between its open and closed positions. When the plastic bar 302 is in its up-most position, the safety switch is open, thus precluding the 10 apparatus 100 from operating. This serves to substantially protect the end user from accidental scalding due to hot water flowing out of shower 300 while the brewhead 104 is open. Latch 106 mechanically grabs a slot on the upper surface 304 of housing 112 to maintain closure. Gasket 306 encircles the circumference of the shower 300 and the top of pod holder assembly 110 to substantially preclude hot fluid from spreading out across upper surface 304 and 15 possibly down the sides of housing 112 potentially producing an undesirable mess during operation. Figures 4 through 10 show various views of the pod holder assembly 110, which is capable of receiving pod 1100 (shown in Figures 11, 12A, and 12B). The pod holder assembly 110 includes pod cup 401, pod cup handle 402, fluid cup 403 and fluid nozzle 404. 20 Pod cup 401 receives and supports a pod 1100 (see FIG. 11) such that hot water pours onto the pod 1100 and brewed liquid flows out the sieved bottom of the pod cup. The pod cup 401 is formed of metal. The pod cup may have an integral or separate pod cup handle 402. Particularly where there is a separate pod cup handle 402, pod cup 401 preferrably has a flange - 8that can be engaged by the pod cup handle to remove the pod cup 401 from the remainder of the pod holder assembly 110. Preferrably, pod cup handle 402 will be made from material that either does not conduct heat or does so poorly, thus allowing an end user to remove a pod soon after a brewing cycle by opening the brewhead 104, removing the pod cup 401 with pod cup 5 handle 402, discarding the used pod, returning the pod cup 401 and handle 402 onto the rim of fluid cup 403 and placing a new pod into the pod cup. As shown in FIG. 4, the pod cup handle 402 may be shaped ergonomically to received a human figure on its underside. By selecting the diameter of pod cup 401, number of holes in the sieved bottom of pod cup 401 and the diameter of each hole in the sieve, the range of time that the hot water remains 10 in contact with the brewable solids can be substantially controlled. The preferred embodiment of pod cup 401 is shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. The height of pod cup, \"h,\" is approximately 12.7 mm and its diameter, \"d,\" is approximately 47.63 mm. In the preferred embodiment, fluid cup 403 and fluid nozzle 404 together form a fluid conduit positioned to receive all of the fluid passing through the plurality of apertures in the 15 sieved bottom of pod cup 401. This fluid conduit further conveys the received fluid into one or more coffee cups 117 (see FIG 1). In the embodiment shown, fluid cup 403 also serves to provide a mounting platform for pod cup 401. While this arrangement simplifies the construction and ensures that nearly all (if not all) of the fluid passed through the pod is received by the fluid cup, other constructions are possible. As shown, in FIG. 7, fluid cup 403 preferrably 20 has a notch for receiving the pod cup handle 402. As shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, fluid cup 403 is a simple cup having floor 801 and an outflow aperture 803 where the floor 801 preferrably slopes toward outflow aperture 803. The brewed fluid from pod cup 401 flows down through the plurality of holes in the sieve hitting the floor 801, which directs the fluid flow toward the -9outflow aperture 803 and out toward one or two waiting coffee cups via the fluid nozzle 404. In the embodiment shown, fluid nozzle 404 slides over the nipple 701 on fluid cup engaging it positively, but allowing for disengagement of the fluid nozzle 404 from nipple 701 to clean and/or replace of same. As shown in FIG. 10, fluid nozzle 404 is a simple tube having two 5 spouts 1001 and 1003 that are sufficiently spaced-apart to allow flow into two separate cups of coffee, but sufficient close together to allow the flow from both spouts to feed into a single coffee cup. Figures 11, 12A and 12B provide various views of a preferred coffee pod 1100 for use in the apparatus 100. Coffee pod I100 is formed of filter material (preferrably paper) and contains 10- a mass of ground, brewable foodstuffs 1200 (FIG. 12B). The ground, brewable foodstuff 1200 is preferrably coffee. As shown in FIGS. 11, 12A and 12B, pod 1100 is a pie-shaped unit. This pie-shape is formed by adhering a planar top sheet 1101 and a substantially cup shaped bottom sheet 1102. Preferably, these sheets are formed of 19 gsm Waterjet paper. This paper is commonly used in the manufacture of tea bags. This pie-shape allows for a greater mass of 15 ground foodstuffs to be used in apparatus 100 resulting in a desired taste profile. In the preferred embodiment, the pod has the dimensions shown in FIG. 11. These dimension allow for a selected mass of ground, brewable foodstuffs in the range of approximately 9.3 grams to 9.9 grams. Various blends of coffee are presently intended for use in apparatus 100: Coffee Type Caffeinated Caffeinated Caffeinated Caffeinated Decaffeinated plus 3% flavoring Weight 9.7 g +/- .2g 9.5 g +/- .2g 9.7 g +/- .2g 9.7 g +/- .2g 9.7 g +/- .2g Roast Color 52+/-2 31 +/-2 45+/-2 50+/-2 45+/-2 (Agtron Model E-10) - 10- Moisture 4%+/- .5% 3%+/- .5% 4% +/- .5% 4%+/- .5% 4%+/-.5% (Computrac Moisture Meter) Soluble Solids 1.01 +1- .05 1.07 +/- .05 1.1 +1- .05 1.07 +/- .05 1.01 +/- .05 (Rasher & Betzold Hydrometer) Residual Sugar 1.1 +/- .1 1.1 +/- .1 1.3 +/- .1 1.3 +/- .1 1.0+/- .1 (Refracto Meter) Grind Type A A A B A Grind type is determined by using an Alpine Analysis with 20 inches of vacuum. Type A has 0% at #16 Screen; 1% at #20 Screen; 6% at #30 Screen; 45% at #40 Screen; 70% at #50 Screen; 0% at #100 Screen and 0% at the pan. Type B has 0% at #16 Screen; 1% at #20 Screen; 5 13% at #30 Screen; 54% at #40 Screen; 76% at #50 Screen; 0% at #100 Screen and 0% at the pan. Coffee flavoring is achieved by spraying the coffee with oils and extracts, or dusted with powders. 3.0% equates to 3.0 ounces of flavoring for every 1 lb. of roasted coffee. Apparatus 100 achieves a method of brewing foodstuffs. The end user places pod 1100 10 containing ground, brewable foodstuffs 1200 into pod holder 402. The measured volume water is heated by a boiler. The apparatus pumps a metered volume of water at a selected fluid pressure. In one method, the apparatus first pumps a small amount of water to pre-infuse the pod. This pre-infusion involves pre-wetting the pod 1100 with water to assist in brewing, which preferrably occurs for 5 seconds. Eventually, the heated metered volume of water at the selected 15 fluid pressure is fed to the pod located in the pod holder resulting in a fluid having a desired amount of soluble solids. That brew fluid is passed into a coffee cup. While various embodiments of the application have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible - 11 that are within the scope of this invention.

       "  'description': 'A COFFEE MACHINEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to coffee machines, and in particular to espresso coffee machines.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAn espresso coffee machine typically comprises a brewing chamber in which coffee grinds are provided. The machine compresses the coffee grinds, and passes hot water through the compressed coffee grinds to create an espresso coffee drink.A fully automatic espresso machine further comprises a grinder, so that the machine performs the full function of coffee beans grinding, compression and espresso drink formation.These appliances typically also provide the function of automated cappuccino brewing with frothed milk. In most cases, steam is used for heating and frothing the milk, in a similar manner to a barista.This type of machine is only suitable for making espresso and cappuccino drinks. However, drip filtered coffee is similarly popular.Commercial coffee machines are able to provide all different types of coffee drink as well as other drinks such as tea, hot chocolate, hot milk etc. These are however high cost machines which are not suitable for a domestic market. For example, CN 2006-14922 discloses a commercial coffee machine which includes an espresso machine and a filter coffee machine integrated side-by-side.US 2015/0033947 discloses an appliance with multiple accessories. A coffee pod accessory or a drip filtered coffee accessory are provided.There remains a need for a full function coffee machine which is able to prepare espresso (and optionally also cappuccino) drinks, but also drip filtered coffee, but without significantly increasing the cost, complexity, difficulty of use, or size of the appliance. \\n\\n WO 96/31125 discloses a milk frothing system which is part of an espresso coffee maker. The coffee maker includes a hot water spigot which may be used to discharge hot water into an airpot.WO 2012/151629 discloses a coffee making device that includes a removable water tank. A steam wand is used to provide a steam output for milk frothing.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe invention is defined by the claims.According to examples in accordance with an aspect of the invention, there is provided a coffee machine comprising:a water supply;a water heater for heating water;a pump for pumping the heated water;a brewing chamber for receiving coffee grinds and brewing coffee using hot water delivered by the pump;an external water delivery nozzle for delivering water from the pump which has not passed to the brewing chamber; anda coffee jug comprising a filter holder for holding a coffee filter and contained coffee grind,wherein the coffee jug and the coffee machine comprise complementary coupling features to allow the coffee jug to be coupled to and decoupled from the external water delivery nozzle.This coffee machine is for producing espresso coffee, based on the use of a brewing chamber in which the coffee grinds are received. However, in combination with a coffee jug with a filter holder, the machine is also able to produce filter coffee. The coffee filter is external to the coffee machine, so the additional filter coffee function does not add space or complexity to the machine. The same water heater and same water supply, pump and water heater is used for all of the different coffee types.The use of a coffee jug for making filter coffee does not require any adaptation to the coffee machine by the user, other than selecting a filter coffee mode, so that the coffee machine can control the delivery of hot water from the pump directly to the external water delivery nozzle.The coffer machine preferably comprises a controller, which is adapted to implement a filter coffee mode of operation and an espresso coffee mode of operation. The \\n\\n controller controls the pump to control the water delivery rate and/or controls the heater to control the temperature. In this way, water is delivered to the external water delivery nozzle during the filter coffee mode and water is delivered to the brewing chamber during the espresso coffee mode, at a different water delivery rate and/or different temperature.Thus, the water delivery rate and/or the water temperature are adapted according to the mode of operation, so that the coffee preparation is optimal for espresso coffee generation or for filter coffee generation.Thus, in a first aspect, the controller may be adapted, in a filter coffee mode of operation, to control the pump to deliver a desired amount of water, to the external water delivery nozzle, at an appropriate water delivery rate. Thus, the water delivery rate from the external water delivery nozzle is actively controlled to be optimal for filter coffee generation.The controller is for example adapted, in the filter coffee mode of operation, to control the pump to deliver a pulsed water flow to the external water delivery nozzle. This pulsed water flow is used to achieve a lower water delivery rate than a continuous flow. This allows the pump to provide a flow rate at a pressure that is suitable for making a drip filtered coffee drink.The controller may be adapted, in an espresso coffee mode of operation, to control the pump to deliver water, to the brewing chamber, at a higher water delivery rate than during the filter coffee mode of operation. Thus, the controller is used to actively control the water delivery rate to be optimal for espresso coffee generation during an espresso coffee mode and optimal for filter coffee preparation in a filter coffee mode.For the espresso coffee mode of operation, the water delivery rate is for example above 3 ml/s, such as in the range 3 ml/s to 5 ml/s, and for the filter coffee mode of operation the water delivery rate is for example below 2 ml/s such as in the range 1 ml/s to 2ml/s.In a second aspect, the controller is adapted, in a filter coffee mode of operation, to control the heater to deliver water at an appropriate temperature. Thus, the water temperature delivered from the external water delivery nozzle is actively controlled to be optimal for filter coffee generation.The controller may be adapted, in an espresso coffee mode of operation, to control the heater to deliver water, to the brewing chamber, at a higher temperature than during the filter coffee mode of operation. Thus, the controller is used to actively control the water temperature to be optimal for espresso coffee generation during an espresso coffee mode and optimal for filter coffee preparation in a filter coffee mode. \\n\\n For the espresso coffee mode of operation, the temperature is for example above 95 degrees (e.g. 100 degrees) and for the filter coffee mode of operation the temperature is for example below 95 degrees (e.g. 90 degrees).The external water delivery nozzle may comprise the coupling feature for coupling to the coffee jug. This may facilitate accurate alignment between coffee jug and external water delivery nozzle.The filter holder of the coffee jug may comprise the coupling feature for coupling to the external water delivery nozzle. For example, the filter holder may be attached to the coffee machine, and the jug may simply sit beneath as a collection vessel. This means only a small and light component needs to be fitted to the coffee machine.The coffee machine preferably comprises a bean-to-cup espresso machine comprising a bean grinder. In this way, the functionality of a fully automated full function espresso coffee machine is extended to include a real drip filtered coffee function, where the drip filter coffee can be made from freshly ground beans.The bean grinder for example has an outlet, which can be configured to deliver coffee grinds to the brewing chamber. In addition or alternatively, the outlet of the bean grinder may be configured to deliver coffee grinds to an external coffee grinds output, accessible from the exterior of the coffee machine. In this way, the integrated coffee grinding capability of the machine may be used to grinds coffee beans for other use, e.g. for aforementioned drip filtered coffee function or a stand-alone drip filter coffee machine or other coffee machine. In this respect, it will be clear that the external coffee grinds output may advantageously be applied in other coffee machines, without the limitations of present claim 1. Therefore, according to an aspect of the invention, a coffee machine may be provided, comprising a water supply, a water heater for heating water, a pump for pumping the heated water, a brewing chamber for receiving coffee grinds and brewing coffee using hot water delivered by the pump, a bean grinder with an outlet configured to deliver coffee grinds to the brewing chamber and/or to an external grinds output of the coffee machine.The water heater is preferably further controllable to generate steam.Alternatively, an additional heater may be provided to generate steam. The external hot water output enables drip-filtered coffee to be made in addition to the internally made espresso coffee, and the steam output enables heating and frothing of milk to enable a cappuccino (or latte or other drinks) to be made. \\n\\n For this purpose, the coffee machine further comprises a steam outlet. The steam outlet may be separate to the external water delivery nozzle, or it may be the external water delivery nozzle (which can thus deliver steam or hot water).The coffee machine preferably further comprises a milk frothing unit for coupling to the steam outlet.The invention also provides a coffee jug comprising:a vessel; anda filter holder for holding a coffee filter and contained coffee grind; and a coupling feature adapted to allow the coffee jug to be connected to an external water delivery nozzle of an espresso coffee machine.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSExamples of the invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:Figs. 1 A and IB show a full function espresso coffee machine;Figs. 2A to 2D show an example of an output nozzle for steam and hot water; Figs. 3 A and 3B shows how a filter coffee jug can be attached to the output nozzle, to enable drip filtered coffee to be produced;Fig. 4 shows a filter holder and jug design in more detail for fitting to the output nozzle shown in Figs. 3 and 4;Figs. 5A and 5B shows a first way to use a full function machine to prepare filter coffee;Fig. 6 shows a second way to use a full function machine to prepare filter coffee; andFig. 7 shows an example of the hydraulic system of the coffee machine.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTSIt should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating exemplary embodiments of the apparatus, systems and methods, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the apparatus, systems and methods of the present invention will become better understood from the following \\n\\n description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the Figs are merely schematic and are not drawn to scale. It should also be understood that the same reference numerals are used throughout the Figs to indicate the same or similar parts.The invention provides a coffee machine for preparing an espresso coffee drink, but which also enables filtered coffee to be produced, such as drip filtered coffee. An external water delivery nozzle is provided, and it provides water to a coffee jug comprising a filter holder for holding a coffee filter and contained coffee grinds (i.e. ground coffee beans). The coffee jug and the external water delivery nozzle can be coupled and decoupled.Figs. 1 A and IB shows a drinks machine 10 in the form of an espresso coffee machine. Fig. 1 A shows a perspective view and Fig. IB shows a view from in front. This example is a bean-to-cup machine, although other options are possible as mentioned further below.It comprises a main body 12, which houses a water reservoir, a water heater and a reservoir for receiving coffee beans. There is an internal grinding mechanism for creating coffee grind, a brewing chamber or brew group for receiving the coffee grind, and a pumping system for pumping heated water through the coffee grinds.The machine comprises a coffee output 14 from which the espresso drink (without milk) is output, after the hot water has been pumped through the coffee grinds. The coffee output 14 faces downwardly and is located over a drip tray 16. Figs. 1A and IB also show a user interface 18 for receiving user selections, such as for water selection and for other drinks selections. There is also an external water delivery nozzle 20 for delivering water (or steam) from the pump, which has not passed to the brewing chamber. This is termed an output nozzle 20 below.In addition to an espresso coffee mode for delivering coffee from the coffee output 14, the output nozzle 20 enables a hot water mode and a steam mode. Some of the drinks selections relate to drinks recipes which include frothed milk and therefore require the generation of steam. For this purpose, steam may be provided from the output nozzle 20. There may also be an option for the generation of steam without being part of a drink selection, for example to enable the user to generate heated and/or frothed milkindependently of any drink to be made by the machine. This may be described as a milk frothing mode.This invention relates in particular to a coffee machine having an external hot water output nozzle such as explained above. In the example of Fig. 1, the output nozzle 20 may be used for hot water delivery or steam delivery, depending on a heat setting of the \\n\\n water heater. However, there could instead be separate steam and hot water outlets. There could also be separate heaters, one for producing hot water, the other one or both heaters acting together for producing steam. The delivery of steam or hot water depends on a user selection at the user interface 18. The steam output may be used for heating and/or frothing milk, and the option of a hot water only output gives additional options to the user, for example for making soup, tea, hot chocolate etc.The operation of the machine in generating an espresso coffee drink is entirely conventional, and the general operation of the coffee machine will not be described further. Furthermore, the illustrated full function espresso machine is only one example of the type of coffee machine to which the invention may be applied. Other types include: a pod or capsule coffee machine, or a portafilter espresso machine, wherein part of the brew chamber is removable from the machine for receiving coffee grinds and manually discharging said coffee grinds after use.This invention relates to the application of a filter coffee jug to the output nozzle 20 so that a drip filtered coffee function is enabled.In order to enable a drip filtered coffee function, the water pump of the coffee machine is preferably controlled to deliver a pulsed water flow to the output nozzle 20. The coffee machine has a controller 11 for this purpose.The output nozzle 20 is located in a docking region 21 for receiving a filter coffee jug. Similarly, a drinks vessel or a milk frothing unit may be provided at the docking region 21.An example of an output nozzle 20 is shown in more detail in Figs. 2A to 2D. Fig. 2A shows a front view, Fig. 2B shows a side view, Fig. 2C shows a perspective view from above and Fig. 2D shows a perspective view from below.The illustrated output nozzle 20 comprises an output tip 22 having an output orifice which faces generally downwardly in use, so that hot water is directed down to a vessel in which it is to be caught, and steam is generated in a safe downward direction.When steam is delivered, it is provided to a steam inlet of a milk frothing unit (not shown). Many milk frothing units are known (and commercially available) which make use of a steam inlet for the frothing and heating of milk. The milk frothing unit may for example comprise a milk container and a frothed milk output. Alternatively, the milk frothing unit may comprise a milk frothing tube (cappuccinatore, pannarrello).The output tip 22 may be spring-loaded or otherwise elastically deformable or retractable so that it deforms or retracts when a unit is docked at the docking region 21, such \\n\\n as a filter coffee jug (in accordance with the invention) or a milk frothing unit (as is already known), and is in this way biased (elastically, by gravity or otherwise) to provide a seal. The tip 22 may thus function as a retaining mechanism between a docked unit and the output nozzle, as well as ensuring a sealed connection between the two.Hot water may be delivered either to a docked filter coffee jug or it may be provided by the output nozzle 20 directly to the exterior of the drinks machine for collection in a drinks vessel.Fig. 2B shows that the output nozzle 20 may be directed downwardly with an offset to the vertical of an angle Q which is for example less than 30 degrees, for example less than 20 degrees, such as 15 degrees. The nozzle 20 is angled away from an external face, here the front face 24 of the machine, from which the output nozzle projects. Thanks to such angle Q the nozzle does not need to project as far as the center of a hot water receiving vessel (e.g. mug). The projection distance d is for example less than 4cm, for example less than 3cm, or even less than 2cm.In the particular example shown, the output nozzle 20 has an output tube 26 which is pivotable about an axis 28, and having the output tip 22 at its lower end. The output tube 26 may be rotatable about this axis 28 between a first direction which is offset from the vertical, and a second, different direction when a unit is docked. The second direction may be more vertical than the first direction and indeed it may be fully vertical. This second orientation is intended to be more compact, and may be used when the output nozzle 20 is coupled to a docked unit so that the unit can dock as closely as possible to the machine. This in turn enables a small drip tray 16 to be used to catch hot water spillage, frothed milk spillage, and filtered coffee spillage, as the case may be.The output nozzle 20 may be rotatable in other directions, for example sideward which may in particular be advantageous if used with a cappuccinatore.Figs. 3 A and 3B show a coffee jug 30 comprising a vessel 31 and a filter holder 32 for holding a paper coffee filter 33 and contained coffee grinds 34. The coffee jug 30 and the output nozzle 20 comprise complementary coupling features to allow the coffee jug and the external water delivery nozzle to be coupled and decoupled. This may be a click- on and click-off function.The coffee jug has as its coupling feature a receiving chamber 36 which fits over the output nozzle 20 to make alignment of the coffee jug 30 simple for the user. The output tube 26 of the output nozzle 20 may be considered to be the coupling feature, in that the chamber 36 is a push fit over the output tube 26. \\n\\n Figs. 3 A and 3B show how the coffee jug 30 can be docked to the machine. It is approached at an angle so that the receiving chamber 36 aligns with the output nozzle 20. When the receiving chamber 36 is pushed over the output tube 26 of the output nozzle 20, the output tip 22 retracts against its spring, elastic, gravity or other bias. The output tip is then received in a recess internal to the receiving chamber 36 so that the orifice of the output tip 22 is aligned with (and optionally also sealed against) a water inlet of the filter holder. This also connects the two parts together, although other or additional snap fit or push fit connection arrangements may be provided.After engagement, the coffee jug 30 may be rotated downwardly. It then adopts a more flush position against the front face 24. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the coffee jug 30 may then sit on the drip tray 16. This provides a simple attachment, because the base of the coffee jug 30 is clear of the drip tray 16 during the initial connection, as shown in Fig.3 A. In an alternative embodiment, the coffee jug 30 may be dimensioned to hang with its base above the drip tray 16 in the docked position.The filter holder 32 is removable from the jug vessel 31.In one example, there is no fixed coupling between them. In this case, the filter holder 32 is attached to the output nozzle 20 in the manner explained above, and the separate jug vessel 31 simply sits beneath in order to catch the drip filtered coffee.In another example, the jug vessel 31 and the filter holder 32 clip together, so the jug vessel and the filter holder may be manipulated as a single unit, as shown in Figs. 3 A and 3B.Fig. 4 shows the filter holder 32 and vessel 31 for attachment to the output nozzle 20 shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The receiving chamber 36 comprises a cradle which fits over the output nozzle 20 and there is a recess 37 which receives the output tip 22.In order to create a drip filtered coffee drink, the controller 11 may control the pump to provide a pulsed delivery of hot water to the coffee jug. An amount of water may be selected by the user in advance, or they may start and stop the water delivery process manually.There are various options for how a drip filter coffee drink may be made.Figs. 5A and 5B schematically show a first option in which the brewing chamber 58 is removed from the remainder of the machine 10. In Fig. 5A, the filter holder 32 is applied to the grinder 38 and coffee grinds are then provided to the filter holder 32. In Fig. 5B, the filter holder 32 and coffee jug 31 are attached to the output nozzle 20. \\n\\n In this example, the user makes use of the coffee grinding function of the machine by providing the filter holder at the output of the grinder, by removing the brew chamber from the grinder output.Fig. 6 schematically shows an example in which the grinder 38 has an outlet 39 which can be rotated between a first position in which it feeds the brewing chamber 58 and a second position in which it is directed to an external grinds output where coffee grinds can be caught in the filter holder 32, when the filter holder 32 and coffee jug 31 are already at the receiving position, coupled to the output nozzle 20.More generally, the coffee grinder may have a first outlet to the brewing chamber 58 and a second outlet to an external coffee grinds output 70. These two outlets may be implemented statically (i.e. with two outlets and a valve to select between them) or a single outlet device which is moved between outlet positions, as shown in Figure 6.The coffee grinds output may be next to the output nozzle 20, as shown in Figure 6, so that the coffee grinds and water may be provided with the coffee jug and filter holder in the same position. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. IB, the external coffee grinds output 70 may be spaced away from the output nozzle 20, and serve to dispense coffee grinds in a coffee filter holder or a portafilter, for use with the illustrated machine or a stand-alone coffee machine.The output to be used (i.e. to the brewing chamber or to the output chute) is then selected by the controller, by operating a valve or drive arrangement which selects between the two possible output paths, for delivering coffee grinds either to the brewing chamber or to the output chute. The controller determines which path for the coffee grinds in dependence on the mode selected by the user.Fig. 7 shows the internal components of a full function espresso coffee machine, and in particular shows the fluid paths in the system.The coffee machine 10 comprises a water container 42, a water heater 44 for heating water to generate steam and hot water and having a water heater outlet, and a water pump 48 for pumping the heated water and steam. There is additionally a water dosing flow meter 47.The pump delivers water to the heater 44. In addition, there is an over-pressure valve 50 from the heater to the drip tray 16 for collection or discharge of waste water.The heated steam is provided to the output nozzle 20 through a first electronic valve 56. \\n\\n The coffee output 14 may have an indine crema valve. The heated water is provided to the brewing chamber 58 through a second valve 60 and also through a control unit 62. The control unit 62 allows water to be discharged to the drip tray 16 for example during cooling down of the heater.The brewing chamber 58 may be driven by a motor 64 for driving the brewing chamber between different positions. These positions include at least a coffee grinds receiving position and a coffee brew position. Alternatively (not shown), the brewing chamber may be opened and closed manually, via a portafilter arrangement.The illustrated coffee machine makes use of single heater 44 to selectively supply hot water of about 100°C (more generally above 95 degrees) for brewing coffee, steam of about 140°C (or more) for heating and/or frothing milk to the output nozzle 20, and water of about 90 degrees (more generally below 95 degrees) to the output nozzle 20 for filter coffee production, depending on the mode set by the user. The temperature control is implemented by the controller. Alternatively, an additional heater may be provided, to produce steam or help the first heater producing steam.The machine may have a pressurizing system for the brewing chamber. It may further have a reservoir for receiving coffee beans and a grinder (38 in Figs. 5 and 6), so that a full bean-to-cup function is provided. Alternatively, the coffee grinds may be supplied in a capsule, pod or the like pre-portioned provision. These elements are not shown as they do not relate to the hydraulic components.An espresso coffee is typically made by forcing pressurized water to flow through a quantity of coffee grinds. The brewing chamber or part thereof may be removably arranged in order to facilitate emptying and cleaning of the brewing chamber. As shown and mentioned above, when removed some examples enable the coffee holder (drip filter holder, brew chamber, portafilter) to be attached to the outlet 39 or external grinds output 70 of the grinder.During an espresso making process, the coffee grinds may be compressed to a certain extent. To this end, the machine may for example comprise a piston, which is movably arranged in a cylindrical brewing chamber, and which is capable of sealing an open top side of the brewing chamber.Movement of the piston controls the extent of compression of the coffee grinds. When the coffee grinds are compressed more and more, a flow through resistance of the coffee grinds increases. During an espresso making process, a brewing pressure at which \\n\\n the process is performed, i.e. a pressure at which the water is conducted through the coffee grind, is determined by the flow through resistance of the coffee grinds.The brewing pressure is a determining factor for important characteristics of the espresso drink, including the taste, and the texture of a foam layer. The brewing pressure is thus for example controlled by varying a position of the piston and/or the water flow.When the machine is to prepare an espresso coffee drink, the heater 44 is first heated up to about 140°C (or more) to supply steam to heat and/or froth milk. The heater is then cooled down to about 100°C to provide hot water for brewing coffee. During the cooling down phase from 140 to 100°C, water coming from the heater may still be too hot for brewing coffee. This water is discharged to the drip tray 16 by the control unit 62.To make a drip filtered coffee, a user places a coffee filter paper 33 in the filter holder 32, provides a desired amount of coffee grind in the filter paper, possibly via the bean grinder if included in the coffee machine, and fits the filter holder to the output nozzle 20. A mode of operation is selected for drip filtered coffee, and the controller 11 of the coffee machine then controls the pump and heater to deliver a desired amount of water at the appropriate temperature and water delivery rate.The temperature or the water delivery rate, or both, may differ as between the espresso coffee mode and the filter coffee mode.The water delivery may be continuous or pulsed. A pulsed delivery of water may be of interest because the pump has a particular function of water flow output versus counter pressure. The pump is chosen to deliver a good flow rate for espresso counter pressures, such as 3-5 ml/s (more generally above 3 ml/s) at a counter pressure (gauge pressure) of 8 bar (1 bar = lOOkPa).For the drip filter function the counter pressure is approximately zero, which would mean that the pump will provide a flow of around 15 ml/s at full pressure.To bring the flow down to desired levels, a restriction may be added in the the drip filter outlet. This however pressurizes the connector and increases the risk ofcalcification. The power supplied to the pump may be reduced by phase-cutting. This requires electronic filtering and thus increases cost.While these are possible options for controlling the water delivery rate, which are within the general concept underlying the invention, it is instead preferred to provide cycled control of power to the pump, i.e. to provide a pulsed output flow. This is a cost- effective solution. Furthermore, the resulting pulsed sound is appreciated by users. \\n\\n Thus, for the espresso function at full power, a flow rate may be provided of 3- 5 ml/s (more generally above 3 ml/s) at 8 bar counter pressure (gauge pressure) whereas for the drip filter function, a resulting flow rate may be 1-2 ml/s (more generally below 2 ml/s) at 0-1 bar counter pressure (gauge pressure).The coffee maker may comprise any suitable type of water heater for heating the water, for example a thermoblock or through flow heater.The invention is of particular interest to fully automatic coffee machines as described above that create a coffee beverage by automatically grinding coffee beans, compressing the coffee, and pumping hot pressurized water through the coffee. Furthermore, such coffee machines have the possibility to create milk-based beverages by frothing milk by means of steam. These machines are known as full function bean-to-cup espresso machines. However, the invention can be applied generally to any drinks machine which has an internal coffee brewing chamber as well as a hot water outlet.For example, the invention may be applied to a capsule or pod-based system which receives pre-compressed coffee capsules or pods, or to a portafilter espresso machine, or to a machine which receives pre-ground coffee.The machine may have an internal or external water reservoir or may be plumbed in.The example above shows only one possible connection scheme between the filter holder 32 and the output nozzle 20. Any suitable coupling or male-female connector may be used. The example shows coupling features which provide a fixed connection.However, the coupling features may instead function simply as alignment features to make sure the flow from the output nozzle reaches the filter holder, but without need a fluid-tight connection.Other variations to the disclosed embodiments can be understood and effected by those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed invention, from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims. In the claims, the word \"comprising\" does not exclude other elements or steps, and the indefinite article \"a\" or \"an\" does not exclude a plurality.

       "  'description': \"CROSS REFERENCED TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis is a nonprovisional application of provisional application Ser. No. 60/684,897, filed on May 25, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference and the priority benefit of which is hereby claimed. This application is also related to application Ser. No. 11/136,961, filed on May 25, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a beverage maker using pre-packed pods and more particularly to a coffee or tea brewer allowing the user to make a single serving of coffee, tea, or other infusible food material.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBeverage brewers such as coffee and tea brewers are commonly used in homes and offices for preparing hot beverages. Some brewers conveniently prepare hot beverages by accepting coffee/tea pre-packed in a pod. A user can dispose of the used coffee/tea pod in one single motion without the customary need for cleaning required with conventional automatic drip coffeemakers or espresso makers or tea makers.The current single-serve, pod-type brewers available on the market have some limitations in that they impose on the user/customer the need to use two different interchangeable pod holders in order to brew one cup or two cups of coffee. Moreover, many one-cup brewer designs have a reservoir or a holding tank which is not fully emptied during each brewing cycle. This can be inconvenient when the amount of water that is left in the reservoir does not meet the desired amount of hot beverage that the user wants when they start the brewer for the next cup of beverage. Some current designs have preset volumes for brewing each cup. This is accomplished by the use of a flow meter which controls the amount of hot water pumped from the brewer. This is a costly and complex approach to metered brewing.OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides a beverage brewer which is highly useful in the preparation of small servings of beverages brewed from pods.In summary, the present invention provides a beverage maker, comprising a reservoir; a heater for heating water in the reservoir from a starting temperature to a brewing temperature; a temperature sensor for sensing the temperature of the water and the heater; a pump connected to the reservoir for pumping hot water from the reservoir at the brewing temperature to a user's cup via an infusible food material; and a controller adapted to operate the pump over a predetermined pumping time based at least in part on the time interval to bring the water temperature in the reservoir from the starting temperature to the brewing temperature. The controller may also be programmed to turn said heater on, turn said pump on when the water temperatures reaches said brewing temperature, and turn said heater and pump off when said temperature sensor senses another temperature higher than said brewing temperature.These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description.BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1is a top perspective view of a beverage maker made in accordance with the present invention, showing a brew head vertically supported on a stand.FIG. 2is a perspective view of the beverage maker ofFIG. 1, showing a drawer and pod holder removed from the brew head ofFIG. 1.FIG. 3is perspective view of a showerhead assembly and the pod holder that comprise some of the components of the brew head ofFIG. 1.FIG. 4is an assembly drawing of the showerhead assembly and pod holder drawer ofFIG. 3.FIG. 5is a cross-sectional view taken along line5-5ofFIG. 1, showing the brew head in an open position.FIG. 6is a cross-sectional view taken along line6-6ofFIG. 5.FIG. 7is a cross-sectional view taken along line7-7ofFIG. 6.FIG. 8is a view similar toFIG. 5, showing the brew head in a closed position.FIG. 9is a cross-sectional view taken along line9-9ofFIG. 8.FIG. 10is a cross-sectional view taken along line10-10ofFIG. 9.FIG. 11is a cross-sectional view similar toFIG. 5, showing the brew head vertically raised to accommodate a taller cup.FIG. 12is a perspective view of a gear housing made in accordance with the present invention.FIG. 13is a view similar toFIG. 9, showing a single pod and a reduced brewing chamber.FIG. 14is an assembly drawing of a locking arrangement for locking the vertical adjustment of the brew head.FIG. 15is a cross-sectional view through the locking arrangement ofFIG. 14.FIG. 16is an electrical schematic diagram for the electrical components of the present invention.FIG. 17is a flow chart used by the controller for controlling the operation of the beverage maker.FIG. 18is a schematic diagram of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONAbeverage maker2made in accordance with the present invention is disclosed in FIG.1. Thebeverage maker2may be used for brewing coffee, tea, or any other hot beverage. Thebeverage maker2includes abase4and astand6. Abrew head8is vertically adjustable with respect to thestand6. Thestand6comprises alower housing10and areservoir12. Ahinged cover14allows for the filling of thereservoir12. An on/offpush button16controls the power to thebeverage maker2.Thebrew head8includes apod drawer18, alower housing20and anupper housing22. Atab24connected to a locking ring (seeFIG. 3) locks thedrawer18in place when turned to the right. Aknob26is operably associated with thebrew head8such that turning the knob clockwise or counterclockwise raises or lowers thebrew head8, respectively.Referring toFIG. 2, thedrawer18carries apod holder28. Theholder28hasholes30that receive the end portions of vertical pins (seeFIGS. 6 and 9) when thetab24is turned to the right. Thepod holder28also has abottom hole32to allow the beverage to flow down into a cup.Referring toFIGS. 3 and 4, thebrew head8includes ashowerhead34and alocking ring36. Theshowerhead34is disposed in a vertically sliding manner within aholder38.Vertical pins40are received withinvertical holes42in a vertically sliding manner and biased downwardly bysprings44disposed around respectivevertical pins40. The vertical adjustability of theshowerhead34with respect to theholder38advantageously allows thepod holder28to accommodate one or more pods, as will be explained below. Asieve46is secured to the bottom of theshowerhead34. Aseal48seals theshowerhead34with respect to the inside wall of theholder38. Aseal50seals theshowerhead34with respect to thepod holder28. Theseal50includes inwardly curled sealing lip51(seeFIG. 8) that advantageously presses against an upper surface of thepod holder28.Vertical pins52are secured to theholder38and are used to lock thedrawer18and thepod holder28in place when thelocking ring36is turned to the right. Theholder38has an outercylindrical surface54which is provided withcam tracks56that engage respective inwardly directedpins58carried by thelocking ring36. Anupper guide60is secured to thelower housing20and provides a guide for the lockingring36.A support structure62includes arack64and aU-shaped member66secured to thelower housing20. Therack64includes alongitudinal passageway68which is used to carry water part of the way from thereservoir12to theshowerhead34. Ahose70connects theconduit68to the showerhead via a one-way valve comprising avalve seat72andvalve ball74.Referring toFIG. 5, apump76is disposed in thelower housing10. The inlet side of the pump is connected to thereservoir12with ahose78. The outlet side of the pump is connected to therack passageway68with anotherhose80. Thehose78may be connected to athermostatic valve82to open or close anopening83in the bottom of thereservoir12. Preferably, the thermostatic valve is made from bi-metallic material which is sensitive to the water temperature. If the water is below 60° C., the valve will close off theopening83. If the water temperature is above 60° C., it will open the opening. This is advantageous for single-serve units because it will eliminate the delivery of a cold cup of beverage at first use.Thehose70is shown connected to thepassageway68and aninlet84on theshowerhead34. Thedrawer18includesoutlet openings86through which the brewed beverage flows out to acup88.Thebrew head holder8is shown in an open position inFIG. 5, wherein theseal50is disengaged from the periphery of thepod holder28and thepins52are disengaged from theholes30. This allows thepod drawer18to be drawn out for cleaning or placement of the pods in thepod holder28for brewing.Referring toFIGS. 6 and 7, thevertical pins52are shown retracted from theirrespective holes30. At the same time, the locking ring pins58are disposed in the beginning and lower ends of the respective cam tracks56.Referring toFIGS. 8,9and10, showing thebrew head8in a closed position, thetab24is pulled to the right, causing the locking ring pins58to ride up along the respective cam tracks56which then causes theshowerhead holder38to move vertically downwardly with respect to theshowerhead34, which then allows thevertical pins52to engage therespective holes30, thereby locking thedrawer18and thepod holder28in place. In the closed position, thepod holder28and theshowerhead34form a sealedchamber90, with theseal50sealing thepod holder28with respect to theshowerhead holder38, and theseal48sealing theshowerhead34with respect to theshowerhead holder38. Pressure within thechamber90advantageously helps in pressing down on the inwardly curledlips51against the top surface of thepod holder28to ensure a good seal. Thechamber90is vertically adjustable by means of thesprings44biasing theshowerhead34downwardly and thepins40being slidadly received withinrespective holes42. In this manner, thechamber90can accommodate one ormore pods92.Referring toFIG. 11, therack64is engaged by apinion gear94rotatably supported by thestand6. Rotating thegear94by means of theknob26allows the user to adjust the height of thebrew head8with respect to thebase4to advantageously accommodate asmaller cup88orlarger cup96. The support structure62includes vertical guides98(seeFIG. 4) received in corresponding pair ofguide grooves100formed on agear housing102fixed to thestand6, as shown inFIG. 12.Ashaft106is operably secured to thegear94. Referring toFIGS. 14 and 15, theshaft106is secured to theknob26. Springbiased buttons108that includeaxial ribs110are received in correspondingaxial grooves112of alock ring114. By depressing thebuttons108, the ribs are released from theircorresponding grooves112, thereby allowing theknob26to be turned clockwise or counterclockwise to raise or lower thebrew head8, respectively. Releasing thebuttons108advantageously locks thegear94, thereby maintaining the height adjustment just made to thebrew head8.Referring back toFIG. 11,water116in thereservoir12is heated to the desired temperature by aheating element118controlled by asensor120, such as a thermistor that senses the water temperature and the temperature of theheating element118. Thethermistor120is disposed adjacent to theheating element118to enable it to sense heating element temperature and water temperature. Acontroller124receives signals from thethermistor120corresponding to the temperature of the water in the reservoir. Theheating element118is protected by athermostat123and a thermal cut-offdevice125. Thethermostat123is in contact with the heating element and is designed to cut off the power to the heating element in case of overheating. Thecontroller124is provided power throughAC lines126and controlled by theswitch16. AnLED indicator light128provides indication when the power is on.Thecontroller124includes a look-up table which correlates the time it takes to raise a given amount of water in the reservoir to a pre-determined brewing temperature with the time the pump is activated to completely pump all the hot water in the reservoir and into a single-serve container such as thecoffee cup96. By counting the time from when the power is turned on to the time the thermistor reaches a desired pre-set temperature, Thot, as for example 83° C. for brewing coffee, thecontroller124looks up the value of pumping time associated with that heating time and turns the pump on for a pre-set period of time plus a standard deviation that is calculated to be, for example, 5-8 seconds. The pump running time will be a function of and controlled by the water heating time, and not by the amount of water measured. The use of a look-up table advantageously eliminates the need to use a flow meter. It also advantageously eliminates the need to measure the amount of water that can be used by the user. All the water that is added to the reservoir is pumped to the cup. Accordingly, the user can use any amount of water that can be accommodated by the reservoir and be assured that the reservoir will be fully emptied when it has reached the temperature that the unit is designed for.An example of a look-up table, establishing the pump run time based on the time it took to heat different amounts of water from an initial temperature of 25° C. to a brewing temperature Thotof, for example, 83° C., is shown below:VolumeIF Tiand IF trTHENPump Run Time150 mL25° C.50secs20 secs180 mL25° C.73 secs35 secs210 mL25° C.85secs48 secs270 mL25° C.105 secs57 secs420 mL25° C.140secs75 secswhere Tiis the initial water temperature in the reservoir,tris the time it took to heat the water in the reservoir to a desired temperature, for example 83° C., and pump run time is the time required to pump out the amount of water in the reservoir. These figures will change depending on the heater size and shape, reservoir size and shape, pump rate, and the initial water temperature.An alternative way of operating the beverage maker without using a look-up table is also disclosed. Thethermistor120is calibrated to established Tdryand Thot. As an example, Tdrycorresponds with the heater surface for dry start (empty reservoir), for example 72° C. and Thotcorresponds to the desired water temperature for brewing, for example 96° C. at a distance of 0.25″ from the heater surface in the center of the reservoir.Referring toFIG. 17, thecontroller124operates thebeverage maker2as follows. Thepower switch16is turned on atstep130by the user. The heater comes on at132. When the thermistor signal corresponds to Thotat134, the pump is turned on at136. When the thermistor signal says Tdryat138and the time since turning the heater on is less than 30 seconds at140, the power is turned off at142; otherwise, the heater is turned off at144and the pump is kept on at146. If the time since the heater is turned off is less than 5 seconds at148, the pump is kept on; otherwise, the power is turned off at142. The 30 secs time is used only as an example for convenience of illustration. It is meant to be a time period much less than the response time of the thermostat or thermal cut-off device so that overheating of the heating element is avoided, when damage to the beverage maker could result.Referring toFIG. 18, a schematic diagram of thebeverage maker2is shown.Water116in thereservoir12is heated by theheating element118. Thethermistor120sends temperature signals to thecontroller124. When water temperature reaches the desired temperature, the pump is activated for specific amount of time based on the look-up table designed to empty the reservoir of all the water into theshowerhead34, through the pods in thedrawer18and into the user'scup88or96. Alternatively, without using the look-up table, the pump is run until after a few seconds, for example 5 secs, after temperature Tdryis reached and the heating element has been turned off.Referring back toFIG. 5, thebase4includes atop wall75with a plurality ofopenings77that drain into acollection chamber79for collecting drippings from brew head.Apod92is a pouch or packaging containing coffee, tea or other type of food for brewing. It should be understood that the pouch may be made of filter material or similar material that allows the hot water to flow through while keeping the contents within the pouch. It should also be understood that the pod is not limited to a pre-manufactured form. The pod may be made by the user using upper and lower filter membranes to capture the coffee grounds or tea leaves. The upper and lower filter membranes are then clamped between the top surface of thepod holder28and the curledlip51of theseal50.While this invention has been described as having preferred design, it is understood that it is capable of further modification, uses and/or adaptations following in general the principle of the invention and including such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which the invention pertains, and as may be applied to the essential features set forth, and fall within the scope of the invention or the limits of the appended claims.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a machine for the preparation of a beverage by circulating a liquid via a portion of flavouring ingredient, in particular contained in a pre-portioned ingredient cartridge, the machine being able to prepare large beverages from such a portion.For the purpose of the present description, a \"beverage\" is meant to include any liquid food, such as tea, coffee, hot or cold chocolate, milk, soup, baby food, etc... Cartridges designate any enclosure for containing a pre-portioned ingredient whether rigid, such as capsules, or soft or flexible, such as pods, and made of any material, recyclable or non recyclable, biodegradable or non-biodegradable, such as aluminium or plastic, in particular aluminium pods or aluminium capsules.Background ArtThere is a consumer demand for drink dispensing machines, such as coffee machines, that can dispense a variety of drinks in receptacles of different sizes. For example, some coffee machines are capable of preparing an espresso coffee or a lungo coffee in a small or medium cup and a \"macchiato\" coffee in a large glass.Multi-beverage machines are capable of preparing coffee, milk, cappuccinos and tea and have dedicated outlets for each drink. For example,CH 685 597discloses a beverage machine which combines an outlet for coffee, an outlet for milk and a water outlet for tea, all outlets being arranged within a diameter of a user-cup located therebelow so that a user always places a cup onto the same spot whichever beverage, i.e. coffee, tea or milk, he requests.Brewing systems are for example disclosed inEP 0 730 425,EP 0 862 882,EP 1 219 217,EP 1 480 540,EP 1 545 278,EP 1 635 680,EP 1 659 547,EP 1 669 011,EP 1 721 553,EP 1 774 878,EP 1 776 026,EP 1 893 064,EP 1 912 542,FR2 424 010,US 3,260,190,US 4,064,795,US 4,760,774,US 5,531,152,US 6,966,251,US 7,131,369,US 2005/0106288,US 2006/0102008,WO 02/074144,WO 03/030696,WO 2005/002405,WO 2005/004683,WO 2005/016093,WO 2005/072574,WO 2005/115206,WO 2006/005736,WO 2006/005756,WO 2006/023309,WO 2006/066626,WO 2007/135136andWO 2008/037642.Typically, the existing brewing systems, in particular using pre-portioned flavoring ingredient cartridges, accept a predetermined amount of flavoring ingredient, such as ground coffee or tea leaves, for an extraction cycle to prepare a beverage portion, e.g. for filling a user-recipient such as a cup or a mug. The volume of beverage prepared from such a predetermined amount of flavoring ingredient depends on the amount of liquid circulated through this amount of flavoring ingredient.For instance, the quantity of water that is recommended for preparing different coffee types varies from coffee to coffee type. Typically, a ristretto requires 25 ml of water. An espresso will normally need between 40 and 60 ml of water. A lighter lungo should be prepared with about 110 ml. A still lighter American-type coffee will require 150 to 300 ml. Hence, the same or similar volume of flavoring ingredient will be used to prepare beverages of significantly different sizes.A problem to such a beverage preparation configuration is the span of the range of liquid quantity circulated through the same volume of flavoring ingredient. For large size beverage preparations, there is a risk of over-extraction of the flavoring ingredient whereby undesirable compounds end up being washed out of the flavoring ingredient by the large amount of extraction liquid and impair the quality of the beverage. In the case of a coffee preparation, this translates into the extraction of undesired bitter oils from deep inside the coffee ingredient.A solution to this problem lies in the increase of the amount of flavoring ingredient for preparing large-size beverages compared to small size beverages. This solution is usually implemented to a certain extent in the expensive full-automatic coffee machines that incorporated a coffee bean grinder and a brewing chamber of adjustable size for receiving different volumes of ground coffee.For machines preparing beverages from pre-portioned flavoring ingredient cartridges, in particular those having an ingredient chamber with a fixed capacity, it would possible to instruct a user to multiply the preparation of small-size beverages using a plurality of cartridges, the small-size beverages being then collected in a single mug for preparing a large-size beverage. However, this puts the burden on the user to adjust the number of cartridges for a given beverage. Moreover, the resulting coffee, i.e. a multiple espresso, may turn out to be significantly stronger than the coffee expected by an American-type coffee drinker.EP 0 806 168discloses a coffee filtering apparatus having a hot water circulation line split into a first conduit leading to a presumably conical filter holder with an extraction chamber for ground coffee and into a second conduit by-passing the filter holder. A large coffee pot is fixed via its mouth to the conical filter holder for collecting and storing the prepared coffee, e.g. the equivalent of six cups, dripping from a non-shown opening of the filter holder. The bypass conduit has an outlet that ends over the mouth of the coffee pot when fixed to the conical filter holder. By fixing the large coffee pot to the filter holder, proper positioning is obtained of the mouth of the coffee pot under the filter holder and the bypass conduit.Summary of the InventionA preferred object of the present invention is to provide a beverage preparation machine that alleviates at least some of the abovementioned problems.Hence, the present invention relates to a beverage preparation machine that has a fluid circuit comprising a liquid flavouring arrangement for circulating a liquid, such as water, through a flavouring ingredient, such as ground coffee or tea leaves, to flavour this liquid and for dispensing this flavoured liquid to a user-receptacle, such as a user-cup or user-mug. The fluid circuit further comprises a dilution arrangement for mixing this liquid unflavoured with the flavoured liquid upon flavouring.In other words, the beverage preparation machine of the invention is arranged to prepare a large beverage, e.g. an American coffee dispensed into a large coffee mug, by circulating liquid through a flavouring ingredient. However, unlike prior art systems in which all the liquid necessary for preparing the large beverage is circulated through the flavouring ingredient, a first part of the liquid is circulated through the flavouring ingredient for flavouring thereof and a second part of the liquid bypasses the flavouring ingredient and is mixed with the first part of the liquid upon flavouring thereof. Hence, when a lightly flavoured beverage is prepared, a reduced amount of flavouring ingredient can be extracted by the passage of a reduced amount of liquid, the remaining amount of liquid required for preparing the beverage bypassing the flavouring ingredient and being mixed to the flavoured liquid to prevent over-extraction of the flavouring ingredient. Hence, undesirable components resulting from over-extraction can be avoided by such a beverage preparation machine since only a part of the liquid needed for preparing the large size beverage is circulated through the flavouring ingredient.Such a beverage preparation machine is particularly suitable to prepare a large-size light tea or coffee by infusing small batches of tea leaves or ground coffee as a flavouring ingredient contained in a brewing chamber of the machine.For instance, the beverage preparation machine is an espresso machine including a brewing chamber having a fixed-volume (capacity) for containing typically 5 to 12 g ground coffee in order to prepare a volume of coffee drink in the range of 25 to 100 ml. By incorporating the dilution arrangement of the invention, the espresso machine can be used to prepare a large size lighter flavoured coffee, such as a volume of American coffee of 200 to 400 ml, from the same volume of flavouring ingredient without over-extraction the limited amount of flavouring ingredient contained in the brewing chamber. For example, 50 to 100 or 120 ml of water is circulated via the chamber containing the ground coffee and the remaining amount of water, e.g. 100 to 350 ml, bypasses the flavouring ingredient, in particular bypasses the ingredient chamber and/or passes via the ingredient chamber after removal of the used flavouring ingredient. The unflavoured water being the mixed with the strongly coffee flavoured water that exits the extraction chamber for diluting and increase the volume of the coffee flavoured water.Typically, the beverage preparation machine is configured for receiving a cartridge containing a pre-portioned amount of flavouring ingredient and extracting the ingredient by passing liquid through the cartridge, e.g. heated liquid. Such a machine has a cartridge seat and a liquid injection arrangement for injecting liquid into the cartridge seat. The cartridge seat may have a first cartridge support and a second cartridge support facing the first support. The first and second cartridge supports may be arranged to be movable relative to one another from an open position - for insertion or removal of a cartridge into the seat - to a closed position - for passing heated liquid through such a cartridge. At least one support of the cartridge support can be hydraulically actuatable and movable into the closed position by the liquid injection arrangement.For example, the preparation machine comprises: a beverage preparation unit arranged to receive cartridges for use and evacuate cartridges upon use, e.g. an extraction device; a housing having an opening leading into an area to which cartridges are evacuated from the preparation unit; and a receptacle having a cavity forming a storage space for collecting cartridges evacuated to such an area into the receptacle to a level of fill. The receptacle is insertable into the area for collecting used cartridges and is removable from this area for emptying the collected cartridges.Examples of such machines are generally disclosed inWO 2009/074550and inWO 2009/130099. Such prior art machines can be modified to incorporate the dilution arrangement of the present invention.The fluid circuit of the beverage preparation machine may have a single outlet for dispensing the flavoured and unflavoured liquids to the user-receptacle. In this case, the mixing of the flavoured and unflavoured liquid takes place upstream the outlet. In this configuration, the dilution step takes place inside the machine so that the user confronted to the dispensing of unflavoured liquid into its user-receptacle is not under the wrong impression that there is a problem of extraction of the flavouring ingredient.Alternatively, the fluid circuit may have a first outlet for dispensing the flavoured liquid and a second outlet for dispensing the unflavoured liquid, the first and second outlets being arranged to direct these liquids to a single user-receptacle filling position below the two outlets. These outlets are normally fixed relative to each other, i.e. not relatively moveable. By avoiding combination of the unflavoured liquid and the flavoured liquid within the fluid circuit, contamination of the unflavoured liquid circuit portion by flavoured liquid from the flavoured liquid outlet is prevented.Hence, in either configuration, the user will not have to move his/her user-receptacle during the dispensing of his beverage, namely the flavoured and unflavoured liquids into the user-receptacle. The user-receptacle will be able to collect both liquids, the flavoured and the unflavoured liquid, in a single receptacle position below the outlets.Typically, the first and second outlets are adjacent to each other so as to dispense the flavoured and unflavoured liquids into a user-receptacle located vertically underneath the first and second outlets. The first and second outlets can contact each other or can be distant by a distance of up to 30 mm, in particular less than 20 mm, such as less than 10 mm, optionally less than 5 mm.The first and second outlets may be arranged one within the other or vice versa. In particular, they may be arranged concentrically. Hence, the first outlet may be arranged around the second outlet or the second outlet may be arranged around the first outlet. Thereby, the dilution of strong or concentrated flavoured liquid by unflavoured liquid takes place downstream these outlets with no risk of cross-contamination of the respective parts of fluid circuit and arrangements.The distance between the outlets and their orientation should be such that the flavoured and unflavoured liquids may both enter the mouth of a user-receptacle when in a beverage collection position below the outlets for filling the receptacle.Normally a cup has a mouth with a diameter of 2.5 to 10 cm. A mug may have a mouth with a diameter of 8 to 15 cm. In a typical configuration, only mugs will have to collect the liquids from both outlets. Usually, a cup will only have to collect the flavoured liquid from the first outlet. Hence, the beverage preparation machine may have a dispensing configuration, e.g. one or two liquid outlets, for dispensing the flavoured and unflavoured liquids from the fluid circuit to a receptacle filling zone within a notional generally upright virtual cylinder having a diameter in the range of 0.1 to 4 cm, in particular of up to 2 cm, such as up to 1 or 0.5 cm.The proximity of the first and second outlets, and optionally of at least one further outlet, ensures that regular size drinking cups or mugs do not require any particular positioning arrangement under the outlets to collect liquid therefrom. Hence, the cups and mugs can be easily freely positioned under the outlets and properly collect the liquids dispensed therefrom.In an embodiment, the fluid circuit has a beverage dispensing head for dispensing the flavoured and unflavoured liquids to a user-receptacle located below the dispensing head. In particular, the dispensing head has a first outlet for dispensing the flavoured liquid and a second outlet for dispensing the unflavoured liquid or a single outlet for dispensing the flavoured and unflavoured liquids. Typically, the beverage dispensing head extends generally horizontally over a beverage dispensing area for positioning a user-receptacle, in particular over a receptacle support device optionally with a drip collection arrangement for collecting waste drips of the unflavoured and flavoured liquids.Usually, the beverage preparation machine includes a control unit that is associated with the fluid circuit and that is arranged for preparing: a large beverage by dispensing flavoured and unflavoured liquids to a user-mug; and a small beverage by dispensing only flavoured liquid to a user-cup. In particular, the control unit is connected to a user-interface for selecting large and small beverages.The beverage preparation machine can be arranged to dispense simultaneously flavoured and unflavoured liquids. The machine may be arranged to dispense these liquids sequentially. The dispensing of these liquids may be chronologically overlapping, i.e. partly simultaneous and partly sequential.Hence, from a single user-operation initiating dispensing of a beverage, e.g. a \"one-touch\" beverage dispensing, both the flavoured and the unflavoured liquids can be dispensed to a user-receptacle. The dispensing process is thus facilitated for the user and accelerated, the process being particularly fast when the flavoured and unflavoured liquids are dispensed simultaneously.The fluid circuit usually has at least one pump. The same pump may be used for circulating the liquid in the flavouring arrangement and in the dilution arrangement. The fluid circuit can have a first pump for circulating the liquid in the flavouring arrangement and a second pump for circulating the liquid in the dilution arrangement.The fluid circuit usually has at least one heater. The same heater may be used for heating the liquid circulated in the flavouring arrangement and the liquid circulated in the dilution arrangement. The fluid circuit may include a first heater for heating the liquid circulated in the flavouring arrangement and a second heater for heating the liquid circulated in the dilution arrangement. Depending on the kind of beverage, it is also possible to heat only the liquid circulated in the flavouring arrangement or only the liquid circulated in the dilution arrangement. This may be the case when the final beverage is supposed to be cold, e.g. ice coffee with or without ice cubes.It is also possible to set the heating for the flavoured liquid at a temperature different to the heating of the unflavoured liquid, using one heater that with sequential dispensing of the flavoured and unflavoured liquids or two heaters for sequential or simultaneous dispensing of these liquids. This is particularly advantageous when the temperature of the dispensed beverage should be different, e.g. warmer or cooler, to the optimal temperature for extracting the flavouring ingredient.Using two heaters may also be required to provide enough heating energy of the large volumes of liquids to be heated. Alternatively, a single higher power heater may be used or an instant heater may be used that can heat the required amount of water to prepare large beverage amounts.The flavouring arrangement typically has a chamber for receiving a flavouring ingredient in particular an infusible ingredient such as ground coffee or tea leaves, optionally supplied within a pre-portioned cartridge. Such an ingredient chamber has an inlet for unflavoured liquid and an outlet for liquid flavoured by circulating through the flavouring ingredient. Normally, the dilution arrangement is arranged for mixing the flavoured and unflavoured liquids downstream the ingredient chamber.Further features and advantages of the invention will appear in the description of the detailed description.Brief Description of the DrawingsThe invention will now be described with reference to the schematic drawings, wherein:Figure 1shows, in a perspective view from below, a dispensing head of a beverage preparation machine;Figure 2is a cross-sectional view of the dispensing head ofFig. 1;Figures 3 and 4disclose two different embodiments of a fluid circuit of a beverage preparation machine according to the invention; andFigures 5 and 6disclose two possible beverage outlet configurations for a beverage preparation machine according to the invention.Detailed descriptionThe invention is now described with reference to the particular embodiments illustrated inFigs 1 to 6. The exemplary embodiments are described with particular reference to the field of coffee preparation. However, the invention is also applicable to the preparation of other beverages, in particular such beverages that involve the extraction of a flavouring ingredient, such as tea.Figures 1 to 3show part of amachine1 for preparing coffee by circulating heated liquid, normally water for the preparation of coffee, through an ingredient cartridge in the form of asoft pod2 or rigid capsule 2\\', e.g. made of a sealed and air-tight aluminium envelope containing the beverage ingredient e.g. roast and ground coffee, as for example commercialised by NESPRESSO™.Machine1 has a fluid circuit 3-10b at least partly enclosed in amachine housing20. Fluid circuit 3-10b includes awater flavouring arrangement3,4,5 for circulating water through aflavouring ingredient2,2\\' in the form of ground coffee for flavouring the water with coffee flavours and for dispensing the flavoured water to a user-receptacle100, such as a user-cup or user-mug.Thewater flavouring arrangement3,4,5 is connected to a water source, e.g. awater tank6, apump7, aheater8 and has abrewing unit4,5 with acartridge seat3. Brewingunit4,5,water tank6, pump 6,heater8 are in fluid communication via aconduit system9,9a.The brewing unit comprises afirst cartridge support4 and asecond cartridge support5 facingfirst cartridge support4.Supports4,5 are arranged to receivecartridge2,2\\' in an open spaced apart configuration and to enclosecartridge2,2\\' in a closed urged together extraction configuration. Brewingunit4,5 is opened and closed by actuatinghandle30.Cartridge seat3 forms a flavouring ingredient extraction chamber when supports 4,5 are urged together.Cartridges2,2\\' are introduced intobrewing unit4,5 in its open configuration via a cartridge introduction channel 3\\' and removed therefrom upon use via a cartridge evacuation channel 3\\'\\'. Therefrom, used-cartridges2,2\\' descend by gravity, e.g. drop, and are collecting in a used-cartridge collection receptacle3a.Brewingunit4,5 is in fluid communication withoutlet10a via aconduit9a that comprises: aspout arrangement9a\\' into which flavoured liquid drains frombrewing unit4,5; and afunnel arrangement9a\\'\\' for guiding the flavoured liquid draining fromspout arrangement9a\\' intooutlet10a.Further details concerning the flavouring arrangement up to and including the brewing unit are for example disclosed inEP2 070 454,WO 2009/130099and in particular inEP 09172187andEP 09177592, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by way of reference.In accordance with the invention, fluid circuit 3-10b ofbeverage preparation machine1 further comprises adilution arrangement9\\', 9b, 10b for mixing the liquid unflavoured, e.g. water fromwater source6 and unflavoured by coffee, with the flavoured liquid upon flavouring, e.g. the water flavoured with coffee flavours inextraction chamber3.Fluid circuit 3-10b has a dispensingconfiguration10a, 10b for dispensing the flavoured and unflavoured liquids from fluid circuit 3-10b to a receptacle fillingzone supporting receptacle100 within a notionalvirtual dispensing cylinder11 having a diameter 11\\' in the range of 0.1 to 4 cm, in particular 0.2 to 2 cm, such as 0.3 to 1 cm.Fluid circuit 3-10b comprises afirst outlet10a for dispensing the flavoured liquid fromchamber3 viapassage9a and asecond outlet10b for dispensing the unflavouredliquid bypassing chamber3 viaconduit10b.First outlet10a andsecond outlet10b are arranged to direct these liquids to a single filling position for a user-receptacle100 belowoutlets10a, 10b. In other words,outlets9a,9b are sufficiently close together that receptacle 100 can collect both liquids in a single collection position, i.e. without having to displacereceptacle100 from under one outlet to an under the other outlet. As illustrated inFig. 2, first andsecond outlets10a, 10b are adjacent to each other so as to dispense the flavoured and unflavoured liquids into user-receptacle100 located vertically underneath first andsecond outlets10a, 10b. In this embodiment, first andsecond outlets10a, 10b nearly contact each other.Outlets10a, 10b can for example be spaced apart by a distance of 0.1 to 3 mm.Fluid circuit 3-10b comprises abeverage dispensing head10 for dispensing the flavoured and unflavoured liquids to a user-receptacle100 located below dispensinghead10. As illustrated inFigs 1and2, dispensinghead10 comprises fixedly mounted therein:first outlet10a for dispensing the flavoured liquid; andsecond outlet10b for dispensing the unflavoured liquid.Dispensing head10 may be formed as part of the housing or of the frame or of the brewing unit structure of the beverage preparation machine. As illustrated,beverage dispensing head10 projects out of the machine\\'s main body generally horizontally over a beverage dispensing area for a user-receptacle100, inparticular dispensing head10 extends over dispensingcylinder11.As shown inFigs 1and2, dispensing head extends overhangingly over areceptacle support device20 with a drip collection arrangement for collecting waste drips of said unflavoured and flavoured liquids. Such a support arrangement for receptacles is preferably configured for accepting receptacles of different sizes and heights such as small capacity cups and large capacity mugs, for instance as disclosed inEP1 731 065,EP1 867 260or inWO 2006/050769, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by way of reference.Also illustrated inFigs 1and2, a light means 12, such as an LED or other light source, are provided abovesupport device20 for illumination thereof. For instance, light means 12 are used to illuminatedevice20 for indicating a state of readiness ofbeverage preparation machine1 for receiving a user-recipient100 and dispense a beverage. Light means 12 may also combine a light emitter and light sensor for detecting the presence and/or size ofreceptacle100 when placed under the liquid outlets and/or for sensing the level of fill inreceptacle100 during a beverage dispensing process.Machine1 may in particular incorporate an arrangement to assist the user for accurately filling the cup to a desired level, as for instance disclosed inWO 2006/063645,WO 2008/138710andWO 2009/135821. Moreover, light means 12 may be used to prevent large-size beverage dispensing when no receptacle is located underneathoutlets10a, 10b, when an insufficiently large receptacle is located underneath the outlets for collecting a user-requested amount of beverage, or when the receptacle is not located properly under alloutlets10a, 10b required for carrying out a requested dispensing program.Turning more specifically toFigs 3 and 4which schematically illustrate fluid circuit 3-10c,beverage preparation machines1 have each a serial arrangement of awater tank6, apump7 and aheater8 connected byfluid conduits9. Afterheater8, fluid circuit 3-10c has a fluid fork leading: on the one hand to afluid flavouring arrangement3,4,5,9a; and on the other hand to adilution arrangement9b, 9\\' bypassing the flavouring arrangement.Dilution arrangement9b, 9\\' is configured for mixing the unflavoured liquid, e.g. plain heated water, to the flavoured liquid, e.g. strong coffee.Thereby, the flavoured liquid is diluted by the unflavoured liquid and the volume dispensed bybeverage preparation machine1 during a beverage preparation batch from a pre-portioned amount of extractible flavouring ingredient 2\\' is increased. It follows that lighter and larger beverages can be obtained and dispensed from a single pre-portioned amount of extractible flavouring ingredient 2\\' without risk of over-extraction thereof.To adjust the ratio of the mixture of flavoured and unflavoured liquids dispensed bybeverage preparation machine1 during a batch preparation of a large-size beverage, a valve 9\\' is provided alongdilution arrangement9\\', 9b. When valve 9\\' is closed, the liquid flows alongconduit9a and throughbrewing unit4,5 for extracting flavouring ingredient 2\\'. From there, (concentrated) flavoured liquid is dispensed atoutlet10adownstream brewing unit4,5 and flows into user-receptacle100, such as a small-size cup or a large-size mug. When valve 9\\' is open, the liquid flows alongconduit9b, namely the path of least resistance, bypassesbrewing unit4,5, and is dispensed fromoutlet10b intorecipient100. In this case, the mixing of flavoured and unflavoured liquids takes place outsidemachine1. The flavoured and unflavoured liquid dispensing process can be sequential depending on the open and closed state of valve 9\\'.As a variation, in the embodiment shown inFig. 4in which the same references designate the same elements, fluid circuit 3-9c,10c comprises asingle outlet10c connected via acommon fluid conduit9c to:brewing unit4,5 supplying flavoured liquid viaconduit9a; and bypassingchannel9b supplying unflavoured liquid, for dispensing both flavoured and unflavoured liquids into user-recipient100. In this case, the flavouring arrangement and the bypassing arrangement are not separated in the fluid circuit and there is a risk of contamination of the dilution arrangement with flavoured liquid. This problem may be solved, if necessary, by introducing a check valve or anti-return valve 9\\'\\'downstream dilution arrangement9\\', 9b and/or by rinsing dilution arrangement upon use.In a further configuration, as disclosed inFigs 5 and 6, it is possible to provide afirst outlet10a\\', 10a\\'\\' for the flavoured liquid and asecond outlet10b\\', 10b\\'\\' for the unflavoured liquid, one outlet being located within the other, in particular concentrically. In this case, even though the downstream part of theflavouring arrangement4,5,9a and of thedilution arrangement9\\', 9b are distinct, i.e. the mixture of flavoured and unflavoured liquids takes placedownstream outlets10a\\', 10a\\'\\', 10b\\', 10b\\'\\', these outlets appear to a user to form a single outlet. Consequently, an undesirable impression that the beverage is cut with water, as result from the preparation of a beverage using the machines illustrated inFigs 1 to 3, may be avoided while preventing any contamination of the dilution arrangement with flavoured liquid.InFig. 5, unflavouredliquid outlet10b\\' is arranged around flavouredliquid outlet10a\\'. InFig. 6, flavouredliquid outlet10a\\'\\' is arranged around unflavouredliquid outlet10b\\'\\'.Valve 9\\' may be a variable flow valve that may be so controlled to permit circulation of the liquid simultaneously inflavouring arrangement4,5 and in thedilution arrangement9\\', 9b so that flavoured and unflavoured liquids are dispensed simultaneously from outlet(s) 10a, 10a\\', 10a\\'\\', 10b, 10b\\' , 10b\\'\\', 10c.Beverage preparation machine1 may in particular include a control unit (not shown) that is associated withfluid circuit3,10c and that is arranged for preparing: a large beverage by dispensing flavoured and unflavoured liquids to a user-mug; and a small beverage by dispensing only flavoured liquid to a user-cup. The control unit is in particular connected to a user-interface for selecting large and small beverages, as known in the art of beverage preparation machines, in particular coffee machines.',\n",

Here, thecontrol unit17may acquire the time when the information on thevehicle10is acquired, with the timekeeping function. Thecontrol unit17may transmit to theinformation processing device20information in which the acquired time is associated with the information on thevehicle10. Hereinafter, the time when thecontrol unit17acquires the position information of thevehicle10from thepositioning unit15is also referred to as “acquisition time”. Further, the time when thecontrol unit17acquires the data of the captured image from the on-board camera12is also referred to as “imaging time”. The imaging time can be regarded as the time when the on-board camera12generates the data of the captured image through imaging.Thecontrol unit17may transmit the information on thevehicle10to theinformation processing device20at a time interval set in advance. The time interval may be appropriately set based on the average speed of thevehicle10, the size of thearea3, and the like. The time interval is shorter than, for example, a time period from a time when thevehicle10enters thearea3to a time when thevehicle10leaves thearea3. With such a configuration, the information on thevehicle10can be transmitted from thevehicle10to theinformation processing device20at least once from the time when thevehicle10enters thearea3to the time when thevehicle10leaves thearea3.As shown inFIG.2, theinformation processing device20includes acommunication unit21, astorage unit22, and acontrol unit23.Thecommunication unit21can include at least one communication module that can be connected to thenetwork2.

Thestorage unit22may function as a main storage device, an auxiliary storage device, or a cache memory. Thestorage unit22stores data used for the operations of theinformation processing device20and data obtained through the operations of theinformation processing device20.For example, map information of thearea3is stored in thestorage unit22. The map information of thearea3may be road map information for vehicles. The map information of thearea3can include position information of intersections, position information of traffic signals, position information of stop signs, position formation of parking-prohibited places, and the like.

In the map information of thearea3, the roads may be associated with information on a reference speed described later. Thestorage unit22may store the information on the reference speed, which will be described later, associated with the width of the road.For example, information on the control timing of traffic signal is stored in thestorage unit22. The information on the control timing of the traffic signal includes, for example, information on the timing when the signal of the traffic signal becomes a stop instruction signal, information on the timing when the signal of the traffic signal becomes an advancement permission signal, and the like.The information stored in thestorage unit22may be acquired from an external server via thenetwork2through thecontrol unit23and thecommunication unit21, for example. The information stored in thestorage unit22may be updated and communicated via thenetwork2as appropriate.Thecontrol unit23can include at least one processor, at least one dedicated circuit, or a combination thereof, similarly to the configuration of thecontrol unit17. Thecontrol unit23can perform processes related to the operations of theinformation processing device20while controlling various units of theinformation processing device20.The function of theinformation processing device20can be realized by executing the information processing program according to the present embodiment with the processor corresponding to thecontrol unit23. That is, the function of theinformation processing device20can be realized by software. The information processing program can cause the computer to function as theinformation processing device20by causing the computer to perform the operations of theinformation processing device20. That is, the computer can function as theinformation processing device20by performing the operations of theinformation processing device20according to the information processing program.A part or all of the functions of theinformation processing device20may be realized by a dedicated circuit corresponding to thecontrol unit23. That is, a part or all of the functions of theinformation processing device20may be realized by hardware.Thecontrol unit23can transmit and receive the information on at least onevehicle10traveling in thearea3through thecommunication unit21via thenetwork2. When thecontrol unit23detects that there is thevehicle10in thearea3based on the received information on thevehicle10, the information on thevehicle10may be regarded as the information on thevehicle10traveling in thearea3.As an example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the position information of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may detect that there is thevehicle10in thearea3based on the position information of thevehicle10and the map information of thearea3stored in thestorage unit22. Specifically, thecontrol unit23may detect that there is thevehicle10in thearea3when the position of thevehicle10is included in thearea3.As another example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the data of the captured image of the on-board camera12, thecontrol unit23may detect that there is thevehicle10in thearea3by analyzing the data of the captured image. Specifically, thecontrol unit23may detect that there is thevehicle10in thearea3, when thecontrol unit23analyzes the data of the captured image to detect a signboard such as a guide sign located in thearea3from the captured image. In the present embodiment, the process of analyzing the data of the captured image with thecontrol unit23may include an object detection process and an object recognition process.Thecontrol unit23determines the degree of danger of thearea3based on the information of at least onevehicle10traveling in thearea3. The degree of danger may be an index indicating the degree of danger due to road traffic. The higher the degree of danger, the greater the degree of danger due to road traffic in thearea3. The degree of danger may be given as a numerical value. In such a case, the higher the degree of danger, the larger the numerical value may be. The degree of danger may be given as any level. The degree of danger is given, for example, as three levels “low”, “medium”, and “high”. An example of the process for determining the degree of danger will be described below. In the following process example, it is assumed that the information on thevehicle10is the information on thevehicle10traveling in thearea3.Example 1When the information on thevehicle10includes the information on the speed of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger by analyzing the information on the speed of thevehicle10. Here, the higher the speed of thevehicle10, the higher the possibility that thevehicle10will cause an accident. Further, the higher the speed of thevehicle10, the greater the damage caused by the accident when thevehicle10causes an accident. That is, the speed of thevehicle10traveling in thearea3can be related to the risk level of thearea3. Thus, the degree of danger of thearea3can be determined by analyzing the information on the speed of thevehicle10.When the speed of thevehicle10is higher than a reference speed set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the speed of thevehicle10is equal to or lower than the reference speed. Thecontrol unit23may use the maximum speed of thevehicle10detected while the vehicle is traveling in thearea3as the speed of thevehicle10.When the maximum speed of thevehicle10that is detected while the vehicle is traveling in thearea3is used as the speed of thevehicle10, the reference speed may be appropriately set based on the speed limit effor thevehicle10defined by the traffic rule such as the Road Traffic Act applied to thearea3. The reference speed may be the same as the speed limit for thevehicle10defined by the traffic rule. Alternatively, the reference speed may be appropriately set within the range of the speed limit ±10 km for thevehicle10defined by the traffic rule.The reference speed may be set in advance in accordance with the width of the road. When thevehicle10travels on a narrow road at high speed, an accident caused by thevehicle10is more likely to occur compared with the case where thevehicle10travels on a wide road at high speed. The reference speed may be set lower as the width of the road in thearea3is narrower. As an example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the position information of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may specify the road on which thevehicle10is positioned based on the position information of thevehicle10and the map information of thearea3stored in thestorage unit22. Thecontrol unit23may acquire the reference speed associated with the specified road from the map information of thearea3stored in thestorage unit22. As another example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the data of the captured image of the on-board camera12, thecontrol unit23may estimate the width of the road on which thevehicle10is positioned by analyzing the data of the captured image. In such a case, thecontrol unit23may acquire the reference speed associated with the estimated road width from thestorage unit22.Thecontrol unit23may detect the number ofvehicles10traveling at speeds exceeding the reference speed in a set period set in advance. The set period may be set in advance based on, for example, the number ofvehicles10traveling in thearea3in one day. The set period is, for example, several days to several weeks. When the number of detectedvehicles10exceeds the set number set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number ofvehicles10is equal to or less than the set number. The set number may be set in advance based on the traffic volume and the like in thearea3.Example 2When the information on thevehicle10includes the information on the number of times the horn of thevehicle10is honked, thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger of thearea3by analyzing the information on the number of times that the horn of thevehicle10is honked. In general, the horn of thevehicle10can be operated by the driver, when the driver wants to avoid danger, and the like. Therefore, the degree of danger of thearea3can be determined by analyzing the information on the number of times the horn is honked.When the number of times the horn of thevehicle10is honked is more than a reference number of times set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number of times the horn is honked is equal to or less than the reference number of times. The reference number of times may be set in advance based on the number of times an ordinary driver operates the horn during each driving.Thecontrol unit23may detect the number ofvehicles10for which the detected number of times the horn is honked exceeds the reference number of times during the above-mentioned set period. When the number of detectedvehicles10exceeds the set number, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number ofvehicles10is equal to or less than the set number.Example 3When the information on thevehicle10includes the information on the deceleration of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger of thearea3by analyzing the information on the deceleration of thevehicle10. Here, if thevehicle10suddenly decelerates, thevehicle10may be hit by another vehicle or the like behind thevehicle10. In addition, the driver may suddenly decelerate thevehicle10in order to avoid an accident. That is, the deceleration of thevehicle10traveling in thearea3may be related to the risk level of thearea3. Thus, the degree of danger of thearea3can be determined by analyzing the information on the deceleration of thevehicle10.When the deceleration of thevehicle10is larger than a reference deceleration set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the deceleration of thevehicle10is equal to or smaller than the reference deceleration. The reference deceleration may be set in advance based on the deceleration of thevehicle10when sudden braking is applied.Thecontrol unit23may detect the number ofvehicles10that have traveled at decelerations exceeding the reference deceleration during the above-mentioned set period. When the number of detectedvehicles10exceeds the set number, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number ofvehicles10is equal to or less than the set number.Example 4When the information on thevehicle10includes the information on the acceleration of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger of thearea3by analyzing the information on the acceleration of thevehicle10. Here, if thevehicle10suddenly accelerates, thevehicle10may collide with another vehicle in front of thevehicle10. That is, the acceleration of thevehicle10traveling in thearea3may be related to the risk level of thearea3. Thus, the degree of danger of thearea3can be determined by analyzing the information on the acceleration of thevehicle10.When the acceleration of thevehicle10is larger than a reference acceleration set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the acceleration of thevehicle10is equal to or smaller than the reference acceleration. The reference acceleration may be set in advance based on the acceleration of thevehicle10that may cause a rear-end collision.Thecontrol unit23may detect the number ofvehicles10that have traveled at accelerations exceeding the reference acceleration during the above-mentioned set period. When the number of detectedvehicles10exceeds the set number, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number ofvehicles10is equal to or less than the set number.Example 5When the information on thevehicle10includes the information on the steering angle of the wheels of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger of thearea3by analyzing the information on the steering angle of the wheels of thevehicle10. Here, in order to avoid an accident, the driver may suddenly change the traveling direction of thevehicle10by suddenly operating the steering wheel. When the traveling direction of thevehicle10is suddenly changed, the steering angle of the wheels of thevehicle10may suddenly change. Thus, the degree of danger of thearea3can be determined by analyzing the information on the steering angle of the wheels of thevehicle10.When the amount of change in the steering angle of the wheels of thevehicle10per unit time is larger than a reference amount set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the amount of change is equal to or smaller than the reference amount. The reference amount may be set in advance based on the amount of change in the steering angle of the wheels of thevehicle10when thevehicle10is normally traveling.Thecontrol unit23may detect the number ofvehicles10that have traveled at a steering angle of the wheels having an amount of change larger than the reference amount during the above-mentioned set period. When the number of detectedvehicles10exceeds the set number, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number ofvehicles10is equal to or less than the set number.Example 6When the information on thevehicle10includes the blinking information of the turn signal of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger of thearea3by analyzing the blinking information of the turn signal. Here, the driver can blink the turn signal when turning thevehicle10left or right at an intersection. If the turn signal is not blinking when thevehicle10turns left or right, the possibility that thevehicle10will cause an accident can increase. Thus, the degree of danger of thearea3can be determined by analyzing the blinking information of the turn signal.When thevehicle10turns left or right at an intersection and the turn signal is not blinking, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the turn signal is blinking. When the information on thevehicle10includes the position information of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may detect thevehicle10turning left or right at the intersection based on the position information of thevehicle10and the map information of thearea3stored in thestorage unit22. Further, when the information of thevehicle10includes the data of the captured image of the on-board camera12, thecontrol unit23may detect thevehicle10turning left or right at the intersection by analyzing the data of the captured image.Thecontrol unit23may detect the number ofvehicles10whose turn signals are not blinking when turning left or right at an intersection during the above-mentioned set period. When the number of detectedvehicles10exceeds the set number, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number ofvehicles10is equal to or less than the set number.Example 7When the information on thevehicle10includes the blinking information of the turn signal of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger of thearea3in accordance with the result of comparison between a timing of lane change of thevehicle10and a timing of blinking of the turn signal. The timing of lane change of thevehicle10may be a timing immediately before thevehicle10changes lanes or a timing immediately after thevehicle10changes lanes. Here, there is a case where the traffic rule such as the Road Traffic Act applied to thearea3defines the timing at which the turn signal should be blinked when thevehicle10changes lanes. In such a case, thecontrol unit23may determine whether the timing at which the turn signal blinks matches the timing defined by the traffic rule based on the result of comparing the timing at which thevehicle10changes lanes with the timing at which the turn signal of thevehicle10blinks. When thecontrol unit23determines that the timing at which the turn signal of thevehicle10blinks does not match the timing defined by the traffic rule, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the timing at which the turn signal blinks matches the timing defined by the traffic rule.As an example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the position information of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may detect the timing of lane change of thevehicle10based on the position information of thevehicle10, the acquisition time associated with the position information of thevehicle10, and the map information of thearea3stored in thestorage unit22. As another example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the data of the captured image of the on-board camera12, thecontrol unit23may detect thevehicle10that changes lanes by analyzing the data of the captured image. Thecontrol unit23may detect the timing of lane change of thevehicle10based on the imaging time associated with the data of the captured image.Thecontrol unit23may detect the number ofvehicles10for which it is determined that the timing at which the turn signal blinks does not match the timing defined by the traffic rule during the above-mentioned set period. When the number of detectedvehicles10exceeds the set number, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number ofvehicles10is equal to or less than the set number.Example 8When the information on thevehicle10includes the information on the size of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger of thearea3by analyzing the information on the size of thevehicle10. Here, the larger the size of thevehicle10, the more difficult it is for thevehicle10to move swiftly. Therefore, the larger the size of thevehicle10, the higher the possibility that thevehicle10will cause an accident. Further, the larger the size of thevehicle10, the greater the damage caused by the accident when thevehicle10causes an accident. That is, the size of thevehicle10traveling in thearea3may be related to the risk level of thearea3. Thus, the degree of danger of thearea3can be determined by analyzing the information on the size of thevehicle10.When the size of thevehicle10is larger than a reference size set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the size of thevehicle10is equal to or smaller than the reference size.The reference size may be set in advance based on the size of the medium-sized vehicle. Here, there is a case where the size classification of the medium-sized vehicle is defined by laws and regulations or the traffic rule such as the Road Traffic Act applicable to thearea3. In such a case, the reference size may be set in advance based on the size of the medium-sized vehicle defined by the law and regulations or the traffic rule applicable to thearea3. The reference size may include a size corresponding to that included in the size of thevehicle10. The reference size includes, for example, at least any of the length of the medium-sized vehicle, the width of the medium-sized vehicle, and the height of the medium-sized vehicle, in accordance with any of the length of thevehicle10, the width of thevehicle10, and the height of thevehicle10included in the size of thevehicle10.Thecontrol unit23may detect the number ofvehicles10having a size larger than the reference size during the above-mentioned set period. When the number of detectedvehicles10exceeds the set number, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the number ofvehicles10is equal to or less than the set number.Example 9When the information on thevehicle10includes the information on the engine displacement of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may estimate the size of thevehicle10by analyzing the information on the engine displacement of thevehicle10.

Thecontrol unit23may determine the degree of danger of thearea3by detecting the number of commercial vehicles. In general, the size of a commercial vehicle is often larger than the size of a passenger car. If the size of thevehicle10is large, as described above, the possibility that thevehicle10will cause an accident can increase. Further, the larger the size of thevehicle10, the greater the damage caused by the accident when thevehicle10causes an accident, as described above. Thus, the degree of danger of thearea3can be determined by analyzing the classification information of thevehicle10.When thecontrol unit23detects the number of commercial vehicles exceeding the reference number of vehicles set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where thecontrol unit23detects number of commercial vehicles equal to or less than the reference number. The reference number may be set in advance based on the traffic volume and the like in thearea3. Thecontrol unit23may detect the number of trucks as the commercial vehicles. When thecontrol unit23detects the number of trucks exceeding the reference number of trucks set in advance, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where the detected number of trucks is equal to or less than the reference number.Example 11When the information on thevehicle10includes the information on the speed of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may detect whether thevehicle10passed an intersection at which a traffic signal is positioned while the traffic signal was indicating a stop sign, by analyzing the information on the speed of thevehicle10. When thecontrol unit23detects that thevehicle10passed the intersection at which the traffic signal is positioned while the traffic signal was indicating a stop sign, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where thecontrol unit23detects that thevehicle10did not pass the intersection.As an example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the position information of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may detect thevehicle10near the traffic signal based on the position information of thevehicle10and the map information of thearea3stored in thestorage unit22. Thecontrol unit23may detect whether thevehicle10near the traffic signal passed the intersection at which the traffic signal is positioned by analyzing the information on the speed of thevehicle10. Thecontrol unit23may detect the time when the traffic signal indicates a stop sign based on the acquisition time associated with the position information of thevehicle10and the information on the control timing of the traffic signal stored in thestorage unit22.As another example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the data of the captured image of the on-board camera12, thecontrol unit23may detect thevehicle10near the traffic signal by analyzing the data of the captured image.

When thecontrol unit23detects that thevehicle10is parked in the parking-prohibited place, thecontrol unit23may determine a higher degree of danger as the degree of danger of thearea3compared with the case where thecontrol unit23detects that thevehicle10is not parked in the parking-prohibited place.As an example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the position information of thevehicle10, thecontrol unit23may detect thevehicle10in the parking-prohibited place based on the position information of thevehicle10and the map information of thearea3stored in thestorage unit22. As another example, when the information on thevehicle10includes the data of the captured image of the on-board camera12, thecontrol unit23may detect thevehicle10in the parking-prohibited place by analyzing the data of the captured image. Thecontrol unit23may determine whether thevehicle10is in the parking-prohibited place for a reference time set in advance or longer based on the acquisition time associated with the position information of thevehicle10or the imaging time associated with the captured image data.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application claims priority from the following co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Applications 61/788,759 filed on Mar. 15, 2013, entitled SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE; 61/788,705 filed on Mar. 15, 2013 entitled SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR SHARING POWER BETWEEN AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND A WHEELCHAIR; and 61/788,631 filed on Mar. 15, 2013 entitled COMPACT VEHICLE WITH INTEGRATED SEATING AND RELATED SYSTEMS AND METHODS, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.2. TECHNICAL FIELDThe present disclosure generally relates to (i) systems for use by an operator of an electric vehicle to facilitate communication between the operator and the vehicle; (ii) systems for use by a vehicle operator or passenger who is in a wheelchair or similar transportation device that uses a chargeable battery to operate; and (iii) compact cars and neighborhood vehicles for use by an operator or passenger who is in a wheelchair or similar transportation device.3. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ARTPowered electric wheelchairs offer users with impaired mobility a level of independence they might not otherwise have. Users of such devices are sometimes highly reliant on their wheelchairs for even basic transportation and may not be able to transport themselves without the assistance of the wheelchair. It is very important to such users that the wheelchair does not lose power, as such an outage could leave them stranded and vulnerable while they are in the middle of transport from one location to another.Users of such electric wheelchairs may also operate other electric vehicles.One example of such an electric vehicle, a neighborhood electric vehicle (an NEV) is undergoing continuous development, and models continue be developed into smaller and more refined vehicles. More compact designs associated with such refinement may result in vehicles being less safe to operate, especially where those components included in the vehicle may protrude into the interior of the car. Components that protrude into the vehicle may, either during normal operation or in the event of an accident, come into contact with the body of a user, which may be undesirable in some circumstances.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSIllustrative embodiments are described in detail below with reference to the attached drawing figures, which are incorporated by reference herein and wherein:FIG. 1is a schematic diagram showing a network of a plurality of electric vehicles, a net node with WI-FI or another wireless protocol, and a power source;FIG. 2is a diagram of an illustrative vehicle communication subsystem that includes an onboard charger connected to a power conduit;FIG. 3is a flow chart showing a process for communicating with an electric vehicle by connecting the vehicle to a network;FIGS. 4A and 4Bare a flow chart showing a process for communicating with an electric vehicle using a base-station that networks electric vehicles and a cloud or mainframe;FIG. 5is a diagram of a system for using a vehicle battery to charge a user's wheelchair battery;FIG. 6is a flow chart showing a process for sharing power between a vehicle and wheelchair in accordance with the system of, for example,FIG. 5;FIG. 7illustrates a side view of a compact vehicle having a hatchback style rear door transitioning from the open position to a closed position;FIGS. 8A and 8Bare alternative, detail views of a portion of the hatchback style rear door ofFIG. 7in which a seat element is deployed to support the body of a user; andFIGS. 9A-9Dshow schematic, top views of a portion of a vehicle having different integrated seating configurations.The illustrated figures are only exemplary and are not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environment, architecture, design, or process in which different embodiments maybe implemented.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONIn the following detailed description of the illustrative, non-limiting embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof. These illustrative embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, structural, mechanical, electrical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments described herein, the description may omit certain information known to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the illustrative embodiments is defined only by the appended claims.Unless otherwise specified, any use of any form of the terms “connect,” “engage,” “couple,” “attach,” or any other term describing an interaction between elements is not meant to limit the interaction to direct interaction between the elements and may also include indirect interaction between the elements described. In the following discussion and in the claims, the terms “including” and “comprising” are used in an open-ended fashion and, thus, should be interpreted to mean “including, but not limited to.” Unless otherwise indicated, as used throughout this document, “or” does not require mutual exclusivity.According to a first illustrative embodiment, a system for facilitating communication between a vehicle and a user includes a vehicle having a rechargeable battery. The system also includes a communication and control subsystem communicatively coupled to the battery to gather and transmit vehicle information. Such vehicle information includes, for example, battery information and a vehicle identifier that corresponds to and identifies the vehicle. The vehicle identifier may be, for example, a Media access control (MAC) address, or similar identifier. The system also includes a charging station having charging station identification information and an electrical coupling between the charging station, a power source, aid the vehicle. The charging station may also function as a or include a communications base station that coordinates communications by and between the vehicle, charging station, and users of the system. The electrical coupling between the charging station, a power source, and the vehicle is operable to charge the battery using power received from the charging station. The electrical coupling between the power source and the rechargeable battery includes a communicative coupling. The communications and control subsystem is operable to transmit communications to a user from the vehicle and receive communications from the user to the vehicle via the communicative coupling.In an embodiment, the charging station is connected to the internet or another communications network such as a wireless communications network. A user of the system may communicate with the control subsystem using a computing device, and the user may transmit a command to the control subsystem to operate the vehicle using the computing device. Such a command may be, for example, an instruction to start the vehicle motor or an instruction to start a vehicle climate control system. Alternatively, the command may be an instruction to transmit vehicle data to a recipient. The transmitted vehicle data may be, for example, data that indicates the amount of energy stored by the rechargeable battery of the vehicle or the health of a vehicle subsystem.The electrical coupling described above may be any suitable communication schema and may be, for example, Power Line Communication Protocol, Power Line Carrier (PLC) communication protocol, Power Line Digital Subscriber Line (PDSL) communication protocol, mains communication, Power Line Telecom (PLT), Power Line Networking (PLN), or Broadband over Power Lines (BPL). Data transmitted using the selected communication protocol may include charging station identification information, as noted above, which may indicate location information that corresponds to the location of the charging station at which the vehicle is located.With conventional internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles, such as automobiles, communication with the vehicle when not in use is not often critical to the driver being able to use the car. Electric vehicles, however, differ in many respects. For example, a major difference between ICE vehicles and electric vehicles is that when the electric vehicle is plugged in, power usage is not much of a concern. When the EV is not plugged in and the vehicle is moving, however, power usage is a major concern because the vehicle operator could be temporarily stranded if the vehicle loses power. Even if a charging station is nearby, it may be time consuming to charge the vehicle's battery, whereas a user of an ICE vehicle can quickly stop at a gas station and refuel.The systems and methods described herein relate, in part, to a user communicating with their EV when it is plugged in (on external power) for a variety of purposes. The EV may be plugged into a power source, such as, for example, a 110v, 220v, single or 3 phase electrical outlet along with one or more additional EVs. Each EV could be equipped with WI-FI, GPRS or another transceiver type to facilitate radio-based communication. There are, however, a number of problems with radio-based systems that communicate vehicle data. For example, to communicate by radio, the EV would need to be within radio communication range of a base station, user, or other receiver. Such proximity may be difficult to obtain when not charging at a base station or in the presence of excessive interference. Radio systems may also add a layer of complexity and cost to a vehicle.This disclosure recognizes that the consumer wants to communicate with the EV primarily when it is plugged into a conventional power source. If plugged in, there are several “out of band” communication schemas that can use the power conduits for communication. There are several types of communication schemas using power transmission lines that are suitable for transmitting vehicle communication when plugged in. Such communication schemas include power line communication or Power Line Carrier (PLC), also known as Power Line Digital Subscriber Line (PDSL), mains communication, Power Line Telecom (PLT), Power Line Networking (PLN), or Broadband over Power Lines (BPL) which, as noted previously, are systems for carrying data on a conductor also used for electric power transmission. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,608,552; 6,278,357; 6,674,806; 6,619,532; and 5,614,811, which are herein incorporated by reference.In an embodiment, a user uses their cell phone or another suitable computing device as a user interface to communicate with a base station coupled to or embedded in one or more stations. Each such charging station may have one or more EVs plugged into it, each having a transient and/or permanent unique identifier such as an IP address and/or MAC address. In an embodiment, each charging station may be coupled to one or more EVs, ten or more EVs, or one hundred or more EVs.Unique identifiers such as MAC addresses or other suitable identifiers may be assigned to individual vehicles in a manner similar to a vehicle identification number (VIN), and each such identifier may be referred to herein as a vehicle identifier. Similarly, station identifiers may be used to track communications with a charging station. The vehicle identifiers may be acknowledged and used to determine the identity of one or more vehicles that are in communication with the charging station. Both the vehicle identifier and the station identifier may be tracked and analyzed to respond to user queries.Once communication between a vehicle and a charging station is established, the vehicle identifiers may be queried to identify vehicles that are communicating with each charging station. A similar query may also be executed by querying the station identifier to identify vehicles that are coupled to the charging station. The charging station can then provide information over the internet or an extended network to users regarding the vehicles that are communicatively coupled to the base station.The vehicle identifier, which may be a MAC assignment as noted previously, allows the base-station to assign IP addresses through a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and use network address translation (NAT), in conjunction, to separate the local addresses from external addresses. This system may create a more secure environment where the base-station can filter and grant permissions to public client requests to prevent unauthorized users from communicating with a vehicle.An example system that provides for the communications and networking capabilities described above is shown inFIG. 1. According to the embodiment shown in the diagram ofFIG. 1, such asystem100includes afirst vehicle102, asecond vehicle104, and athird vehicle106. Thefirst vehicle102,second vehicle104, andthird vehicle106are electrically coupled to an electrical coupling (and communicative)112, which may be any suitable coupling, as described above. Theelectrical coupling112couples thefirst vehicle102,second vehicle104, andthird vehicle106to apower source110associated with a chargingstation108. As noted above, the chargingstation108includes a communications base station that functions as a net node and is operable to communicate with a network via any suitable communications protocol, such as WI-FI, GPRS/GSM, or a wired network connection.In an embodiment, when an EV plugs into a chargingstation108, it registers with the resident base station. The network then knows where the EV is located (much like a cell tower). When the user wants to communicate with the EV, the user simply inputs the command and is informed if the EV is connected and if the EV received the command via the communications interface.In an embodiment, a cloud network or mainframe is deployed to support base-station and vehicle updates and upgrades, such as firmware updates, software upgrades, and alerts that include useful information relating to the vehicle, such as Technical Service Bulletins. Hardware onboard the EV translates communication messages between the in-vehicle network protocol and the communication protocol occurring over the power conduit. As shown in the diagram ofFIG. 2, avehicle200, which is analogous to any of thefirst vehicle102,second vehicle104, andthird vehicle106described above with regard toFIG. 1, includes anonboard charger206for interfacing with the electrical coupling of a charging station. Theonboard charger206provides power to abattery management system214that manages vehicle power and charges abattery pack216of thevehicle200. Theonboard charger206is also coupled to anetwork controller204that communicates with the various systems of thevehicle200, which are illustrated in the diagram as avehicle network202. Thevehicle network202may include, for example, a controller area network (CAN), Flexray, time-triggered protocol (TTP), TCP/IP, or another suitable communication system or bus that facilitates communication between the vehicle's microcontrollers and other devices within thevehicle200. The selected communication system is suitable for use in automotive or electric vehicle applications and may be a message-based protocol. As considered herein, thevehicle network202includes one or more of the vehicle's systems, and may include an engine controller and powertrain controller, as well as interfaces for gathering data related to the vehicle's airbags, braking system, cruise control, power steering system, audio systems, windows, doors, mirrors,battery216andbattery management system214.User commands may be issued to, for example, pre-warm or pre-cool a vehicle. In addition, a user may issue commands to allow access to manage, change or initiate a charging schedule. Information such as state of charge or maintenance status can be accessed through the communication interface, which may be accessed via the chargingstation208. Where appropriate, aspects of any of the embodiments described above may be combined with aspects of any of the other embodiments described to form further examples having comparable or different properties and addressing the same or different problems.FIG. 3shows arepresentative process300for updating a vehicle's software or firmware and responding to a user request using an electrical coupling between a vehicle and a charging station. The process may start302at any time. For example, the process may start302on a regular or scheduled time interval, any time the vehicle is coupled to the charging stating, upon user initiation, or at any other suitable time. After startup, the system determines whether the vehicle is plugged in to the chargingstation304. If the vehicle is not plugged in, the process stops306. If the vehicle is plugged in, the local network connection is initialized308. Further, the process determines whether there is a connection to thebase station310, which may involve a handshake process or other affirmation that the vehicle is communicatively coupled to the base station via the electrical coupling. If no connection is established, the process may retry the validation process up to five times332(or any other predetermined amount of times) before stopping theprocess334. If the connection is established, then the vehicle identifier (e.g, a MAC address) is shared with thebase station312and the base station stores connection time, location data, and otherapplicable vehicle data314. The process also involves a query to determine whether there have been software orfirmware updates316by comparing the most recent versions of software and firmware stored in the vehicle to the most recent versions available over thenetwork318. If an update is available, then the system performs updates to the applicable software orfirmware320. If no update is needed, the vehicle reads requests, such as the types of user requests noted above, from thenetwork322, processes therequests324, and sends response data to auser326to, for example, confirm that the request was performed. In an embodiment, after processing the request, the vehicle determines whether the charging station connection remains available328and continuously reads and responds to new requests while the connection remains active.FIG. 4shows arepresentative process400for updating vehicles' software or firmware and responding to user requests using electrical couplings between vehicles and charging stations in a system that includes a plurality of vehicles. Like theprocess300, theprocess400may start402at any time. For example, the process may start402on a regular or scheduled time interval, any time a vehicle is coupled to the charging stating, upon user initiation, or at any other suitable time. Here, a charging station initializes a connection to a cloud (an “EV cloud”) or mainframe computer that determines operation of the chargingstation404and determines whether the connection has been successfully established406. These steps are repeated until a connection has been established unless the charging station determines that timeout criteria are met408, in which case the station generates anerror signal410to a user or system operator and stops412.After a connection is established, the station checks its firmware andsoftware versions414and determines whether an update is available416. If updates are available, the updates are downloaded to local storage media and applied to thestation418. If no additional updates are available, the station establishes a local area connection to theconnected vehicles420over the electrical coupling or power conduit. Next, the station reads the vehicle identifiers for the vehicles that are available on thelocal area network422, or connected to the base station, and records the vehicle identifiers that are part of the base station'snetwork424. The base station also queries the EV cloud or mainframe for operating details of the connected vehicles428(for example, from a manufacturer's or user's database) and records the details of each vehicle to thelocal area network434. The details may include software and firmware information and updates for the vehicles that are present.As noted, theprocess400includes the base station determining whether software or firmware updates are available430, determining which vehicles require which updates432, and sending the update information to the applicable vehicles using thelocal area network436. The base station determines whether all vehicles on the network are updated438and the update process repeats until all vehicles are updated. Following the update process, or if no updates are available, the process includes reading requests for the vehicles over the local network or via theEV cloud440and processing the read requests on apriority basis442in which requests are prioritized based on importance or the order in which they are received. Response data is then sent to confirm that the request was received and/or performed444. The base station may then continue to monitor the population count of vehicles on its network446. If there has been a change in the population of vehicles on the network, then the process returns to the step of reading thevehicle identifier information442so that any new vehicles may be updated if necessary. If there is no change in the population of the network, then the process may involve continuously determining whether updates or new requests are received to ensure that the resident vehicles are updated and have responded to user requests.In arelated system500, the vehicle may include a chargingcontroller506that uses the vehicle's battery to charge a battery of a user's electrically powered wheelchair or similar transportation device. As shown schematically inFIG. 5, in an embodiment, such a system includes auser interface514, which may be any of the user interfaces described above or a vehicle-mounted use interface. Theuser interface514is communicatively coupled to a chargingcontroller506having afirst charging bridge504that couples to the wheelchair (or similar transportation device)battery502and asecond charging bridge508that couples to the vehicle'sbattery pack510.Thesystem500may be implemented in a vehicle, which may be an EV or any other type of vehicle, that transports an electric wheelchair. As referenced herein, an electric wheelchair is understood to be any type of powered mobility device, including without limitation an electric wheelchair or scooter that a person may use for transportation outside of the vehicle. Theillustrative system500provides the capability to share power between thewheelchair battery pack502andvehicle battery pack510. For example, if awheelchair battery502is at 50% charge and thevehicle battery510is at 100% charge, the user may charge thewheelchair battery502while in transit to a destination, such as a meeting or event. In the event of a brief commute during which such a charging occurs, the battery charges may have balanced out somewhat so that thevehicle battery510is at a 90% charge and thewheelchair battery502is at 70% charge after the brief commute during which the charging occurs, thereby increasing the range of the wheelchair following the commute.In an embodiment, the user of the vehicle may also use power from thewheelchair battery502to provide supplemental power to thevehicle battery510. For example, the user may be one mile from his or her destination but about to lose all vehicle power due to adead vehicle battery510. In such an embodiment, the user may supplement thevehicle battery510with stored electrical power from thewheelchair battery502to get to the destination or to a roadside assistance location. Such an event would be rare, given that thevehicle battery510is likely to have a much higher capacity (on the order of, for example, around 15 MWh), than the wheelchair battery502(which may have a capacity of, for example, less than 1 MWh). None the less, such a capability may help to reduce costs and provide greater safety to users in the event of an emergency. In such an embodiment, a visual user interface may be included so that a user can monitor the charge levels on each of thebatteries502,510and select the amount of power they wish to transfer to the wheelchair battery from the vehicle battery, or vice versa.In an embodiment, the chargingcontroller506limits the discharge of vehicle battery power to thewheelchair battery502to maintain a power reserve in thevehicle battery510and reduce the chance of a user body standard. Therefore, in an embodiment, the chargingcontroller506prevents deep discharge of thevehicle battery510, which may result in damage to certain types of batteries. In an embodiment, a battery management system of the vehicle can incorporate automatic power sharing based on a variety of factors, i.e. driving style, location, battery health, etc. In addition, the chargingcontroller506and related charging systems may include a voltage conversion system having, for example, a transformer to enable power to be distributed from one battery to the other at a charging voltage that is optimized for the battery receiving power.In some embodiments, a control system that is integral to the battery management system allows a user to input data relating to their transportation habits to optimize the distribution of battery power between thevehicle battery510andwheelchair battery502. For example, a user may input data to the control system to indicate (1) the length of their trip or average commute (to indicate, for example, that their commute is 15-30 minutes long) (2) that their destination has a charging station, or (3) whether they desire to transfer reserve power to theirwheelchair battery502so that and the end of the trip, most of the remaining power will be allocated to thewheelchair battery502. By transferring expected excess vehicle battery power to thewheelchair battery502during transit,wheelchair battery502may be as fully charged as possible when the user reaches the destination. Such an arrangement may be efficient for the user because he or she may then maximize use of thewheelchair battery502after parking their vehicle at a location where thevehicle battery510can be replenished without inconvenience to the user. In such an embodiment, a GPS or other location system coupled to the vehicle may indicate that the vehicle is within a certain distance of a charging station or a power outlet at the user's destination, reserve adequate power to reach the destination or charging station, and divert all remaining power to thewheelchair battery502. Other systems and methods that relate to the interaction of such a vehicle with a GPS system are described in co-pending provisional patent application No. 61/930,299 filed Jan. 22, 2014, entitled AUTOMATED NAVIGATION AND CONFIGURATION SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR LIMITED-ACCESS VEHICLES, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.In another embodiment, the system may be used to charge any auxiliary battery based on user input. For example, a user may divert reserve power to a laptop battery or a battery for any suitable portable device so that they can maximize their aggregated charging time when they replenish the power of theirvehicle battery510.Anexample process600for implementing such a system is shown in the flowchart ofFIG. 6. Theprocess600starts when the vehicle is powered on602. The charge controller next reads the state of charge from bothbattery systems604. The process may also include comparing each battery system and determining the least depletedbattery system606. In addition, the process includes reading the user's desiredload sharing direction608, which may be any of the directions described above relating to the diversion of charge from one of the batteries to the other. The process also includes making a determination as to whether the selected direction of charge (for example, from the vehicle battery to the wheelchair or other auxiliary battery) is from the least depleted battery (the battery having more power)610.If the direction of charge is from the battery having more power to the battery having less power, a signal may be generated to indicate to the user that the selection is accepted616. If, however, the direction of charge is from the battery having less power to the battery having more power, then an alternative signal or alarm may be generated to indicate to the user that the weaker battery will be further depleted if the charge direction is executed612. The user may then decide whether to continue thecharge614and the process will continue and indicate that the selection is accepted616if the user so desires. The charge controller then determines whether the charge instruction involves directing current to the wheelchair (or auxiliary) battery or to thevehicle battery618. If the charge is to be directed to the vehicle battery, the voltage may be stepped up to direct battery power from the wheelchair battery to thevehicle battery620. Alternatively, if the charge is to be directed to the wheelchair battery, the voltage may be stepped down to direct battery power from the vehicle battery to the wheelchair battery at asuitable charge voltage622.It is further noted that in any of the foregoing embodiments, the user will generally prefer for the interior the vehicle to be safe. Thus, as shown inFIGS. 7-9D, the shell or frame of the vehicle may be used as part of the vehicle's interior seating to economize manufacturing costs of the vehicle while also improving safety.According to an illustrative embodiment, acompact vehicle700, such as a neighborhood electric vehicle, has a singleopening hatchback door702, which is used as the back of one ormore seats704. That is, when thehatchback door702closes, theseat704or a similar support structure such as a seat back, is positioned behind the user to provide support, not only for comfort, but for crash worthiness and safety. The seat back might include a headrest or restraints, such as latches, a seatbelt, tie-down anchors, or other suitable features for restraining or supporting the body of a user within the interior of thevehicle700. The restraints may be pre-positioned in the back of thevehicle700, or configured to be easily repositioned by a user (on sides or spring-aided hinges, for example). In an illustrative embodiment, the restraints are positioned exactly where the user needs them, thereby facilitating use of the restraints during safe operation of the vehicle. For example, in an embodiment, the restraints may be positioned based on the user's needs and their expected position within thevehicle700, and may include any of the supports or restraints noted above. Further, in an illustrative embodiment, thehatchback door702may form a structural element of the vehicle, such as a beam or frame member to add rigidity and strength to the body of thevehicle700. In an embodiment in which thehatchback door702functions as a structural element of the vehicle, a seat back or restraint may be secure and crash worthy by virtue of its formation within the frame of thevehicle700.It is noted that the integral restraint and seating elements, such as a seatback or foldingseat704and integrated seatbelt are not confined to hatchback configurations or to back rests. For example, ahatchback door702may incorporate a seat back with a releasable seat element, such as aseat704that easily detaches from thehatchback door702when the operator of the vehicle does not expect to use theseat704. This makes entry to and exit from thevehicle700easier for a user that will not use the seat, and decreases the likelihood of unwanted contact with the body of the user in the event of an accident. In another illustrative embodiment, the side of thevehicle700might include a releasable, removable, orfoldable seat704that can be easily stowed. These features allow for greater safety, but additionally more efficient use of interior space and ease of loading.According to an illustrative embodiment, avehicle700may be a NEV for operation by a person with a disability who uses a wheelchair. Depending on the type of wheelchair the operator uses, theintegrated seat element704may include one or more elements of a traditional car seat, such as a rigid frame that is anchored to the frame of thevehicle700, a seatbelt, an adjustable or fixed seatback, a headrest or neck support, and arm rests. Portions of the integrated seat may be selected and configured to mate with or complement the operator's wheelchair. For example, as shown inFIG. 8B, where an operator'swheelchair708includes all of the needed support with the exception of a headrest, theintegrated seating element704B may comprise only a headrest that rotates into place behind the operator's head as thehatchback door702closes. A seatback may be similarly configured to complement a wheelchair that supports the operator's back, but to a lesser degree than a normal car seat, and may deploy in substantially the same fashion as described above with regard to the headrest. Extendable seatbelt members may also be integrated into thehatchback door702or another extendible portion of thevehicle700so that the point where the operator initially grasps the belt and the point where the operator latches the belt may be more easily accessed by an operator having a limited range of motion.According to another embodiment, a hinged component may be included in adoor702of thevehicle700and configured to engage the operator's wheelchair and rotate into place (partially) around or over the body of the user so that the user may only have to extend a seatbelt a small distance, as compared to a seatbelt in a normal automobile, to secure his or her self in the vehicle.In a similar manner, arm rests orother supports710intended to support the sides of the operator's body may be formed integrally to the body of thevehicle700on either side of the vehicle body and at the expected location of the user. In an embodiment, the side supports710may extend to provide comfortable and functional support to the body of the user while the user is in thevehicle700. For example, where an operator lacks upper body strength, side supports710may extend on either side of the user when thehatchback door702closes or from thehatchback door702, the sides of thevehicle700, the floor of thevehicle702, or even the ceiling of thevehicle702to assist the user in maintaining his body in an upright position that provides better visibility, comfort, and control over thevehicle702.In another embodiment, afolding seat704may be included in ahatchback door702of avehicle700that is intended to be primarily, but not always, operated by a user who is in a wheelchair. In such an embodiment, the cab of thevehicle700may general be empty so that an operator can maneuver his or her wheelchair into the cab of thevehicle700and operate thevehicle700from the wheelchair. However, when the operator leaves and a second operator desires to operate the vehicle who is not in a wheelchair, the second operator may rely on the integrated seating, such as a fold downseat704of any of the types described above, to provide a seating surface he or she may use when operating thevehicle700. In such an embodiment, the fold downseat704may include seatback that is coupled to a folding seat bottom by a hinge. The seat back may include an indented portion that corresponds to the profile of the seat bottom so that when folded up, the seat bottom does not protrude beyond the seat back. As such, the seat bottom may be sized and configured to fit within the indented portion of the seat back.According to another illustrative embodiment, the cab of thevehicle700may be wide enough to seat multiple passengers and one or more integrated seating elements may be used to allow for (1) a driver who is not in a wheelchair and a passenger who is in a wheelchair, (2) a driver who is not in a wheelchair and a passenger who is in a wheelchair, (3) a driver and a passenger who are not in wheelchairs, and (4) a driver and a passenger who are in wheelchairs. Such configurations are shown inFIGS. 9A-9D, in which (a) anintegrated seat902A is placed at the front left portion of thevehicle900A, (b) anintegrated seat902B is placed at the front right portion of thevehicle900B, (c)integrated seats902C,904C are is placed at the front left portion of thevehicle900C and at the front right portion of thevehicle900C, respectively, and (d) an integrated orremovable seat902D is placed at the front center portion of thevehicle900DWhere appropriate, aspects of any of the embodiments described above may be combined with aspects of any of the other embodiments described to form further examples having comparable or different properties and addressing the same or different problems.It will be understood that the above description of preferred embodiments is given by way of example only and that various modifications may be made by those skilled in the art. The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the structure and use of exemplary embodiments of the invention.

       "  'description': 'Autonomous vehicle parking method and systemTechnical FieldThe present disclosure relates generally to autonomous vehicles, and more particularly to methods and systems for parking autonomous vehicles.BackgroundAn autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating with little or no user input. Autonomous vehicles use sensing devices such as radar, lidar, image sensors, etc. to sense their environment. The autonomous vehicle system further uses information from Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, navigation systems, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, vehicle-to-infrastructure technology, and/or drive-by-wire systems to navigate the vehicle.Vehicle automation has been classified into numerical levels ranging from zero (corresponding to no automation with full human control) to five (corresponding to full automation with no human control). Various automatic driver assistance systems (such as cruise control, adaptive cruise control, and parking assistance systems) correspond to lower levels of automation, while a truly \"driverless\" vehicle corresponds to higher levels of automation.The parking facility may include a parking space in which the vehicle may be parked, and a passageway for accessing the parking space. The parking space may have a length as its longitudinal dimension relative to a vehicle parked in the space and a width as its transverse dimension relative to a vehicle parked in the space. The length and width of the parking space may be designed to contain a typical vehicle. Parking a vehicle, whether under driver control or autonomous control, can be challenging. Parking areas may be crowded, spaces in many places may be inconsistent, and various obstacles are often present. Maneuvering a vehicle into a parking space requires coordinated control of steering acceleration and braking.Accordingly, it is desirable to provide systems and methods that facilitate autonomous vehicle parking.

In an exemplary embodiment, thecommunication system36 is a wireless communication system configured to communicate via a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) using the IEEE802.11 standard or by using cellular data communication. However, additional or alternative communication methods, such as Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) channels, are also considered to be within the scope of the present disclosure. DSRC channels refer to unidirectional or bidirectional short-to medium-range wireless communication channels designed specifically for automotive use, and a corresponding set of protocols and standards. In an exemplary embodiment, thecommunication system36 is configured to communicate with occupants of the vehicle, such as through verbal messaging/speech synthesis and speech recognition.The data storage device 32 stores data for automatically controlling theautonomous vehicle10. In various embodiments, the data storage 32 stores a defined map of the navigable environment. In various embodiments, the defined map may be predefined by and obtained from a remote system. For example, the defined map may be assembled by a remote system and transmitted (wirelessly and/or by wire) to theautonomous vehicle10 and stored in the data storage device 32. As can be appreciated, the data storage device 32 can be part of thecontroller34, separate from thecontroller34, or part of thecontroller34 and a separate system. The characteristics of theautonomous vehicle10, such as thelength37, thewidth39, the dooropening swing dimension33 of thefront doors25, 27, and the dooropening swing dimension35 of therear doors29, 31, may be stored in the data storage device 32 in usable data form as the dimension value 45. In various examples, these values are known at the time of vehicle development and may be utilized and stored for reference. For example, the door opening swing data may be used to determine a lateral offset for parking of theautonomous vehicle10 as described below.Thecontroller34 includes at least oneprocessor44 and a computer-readable storage device ormedium46. Theprocessor44 may be any custom made or commercially available processor, a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with thecontroller34, a semiconductor based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip or chip set), a macroprocessor, any combination thereof, or generally any device for executing instructions. The computer readable storage device or medium 46 may include volatile and non-volatile storage such as Read Only Memory (ROM), Random Access Memory (RAM), and Keep Alive Memory (KAM). The KAM is a persistent or non-volatile memory that may be used to store various operating variables when theprocessor44 is powered down.

The instructions, when executed byprocessor44, receive and process signals from sensor systems 28 and 38, execute logic, calculations, methods, and/or algorithms for automatically controlling components ofautonomous vehicle10, and generate control signals toactuator system30 to automatically control components ofautonomous vehicle10 based on the logic, calculations, methods, and/or algorithms. Although only onecontroller34 is shown in fig. 1, embodiments of theautonomous vehicle10 may include any number ofcontrollers34 that communicate over any suitable communication medium or combination of communication media and cooperate to process sensor signals, execute logic, calculations, methods and/or algorithms, and generate control signals to automatically control features of theautonomous vehicle10.The sensor system 38 employs a plurality of sensors, which in one example include sensors 51-54. In other examples, the number of sensors may differ based on factors such as the characteristics of theautonomous vehicle10 and the type of sensors used. The sensors 51-54 may be any device that identifies information about the position of an occupant within theautonomous vehicle10 and provides that information to theprocessor44. For example, the sensors 51-54 provide values indicative of the position of an occupant within theautonomous vehicle10. In the embodiment of fig. 1, the sensors 51-54 may be door ajar sensors that detect the opening of thedoors25, 27, 29, 31. In other embodiments, the occupant position is determined using fastened seatbelt information, an interior camera image, or any other available indication of occupied seat position. The sensors 51-54 may be used to determine whether a door, such asdoor25, has been opened, and the result will be stored in the data storage device 32 as the recorded door ajar value 47. The sensors 51-54 may be configured as switches, proximity sensors such as hall effect sensors, or other sensing devices. The door ajar sensors 51-54 may be configured to provide door status signals to theprocessor44. The door open state may be sensed or determined when the door is open. When the door is closed, the door closed state may be sensed or determined. At least one of the door ajar sensors 51-54 may be provided at each door of theautonomous vehicle10, wherein the total number of sensors corresponds to the number of doors. In other embodiments, the sensors 51-54 may be another type of sensor, such as those configured to detect an occupant. The sensor system 38 may use in-seat sensors such as switches or pressure sensors in theseats15, 17, 21, 23, ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, or any sensor capable of recognizing the presence of an occupant. The sensor system 38 may provide real-time data regarding the position of the occupant, or in the case of a door ajar sensor, may provide historical data from which the occupant position may be derived. For example, when any of thedoors25, 27, 29, 31 is opened for the occupant to enter theautonomous vehicle10, the door open state information may be saved as a door ajar value 47 in the data storage device 32.Controller34 may access the memory to obtain data regarding which door was opened when the trip began by retrieving door ajar value 47.In various embodiments, one or more instructions ofcontroller34 are implemented inparking system100 and, when executed byprocessor44, control the selection and evaluation of available parking spaces. For example,controller34 may monitor sensing devices 40 a-40 n to identify an unoccupied parking spot and determine characteristics of the spot. Theautonomous vehicle10 may scan the parking space and store the result in the form of available data as a scan value 49. When the selected parking space has a limited width,controller34 may access door ajar value 47 to determine which door(s) may be opened when the occupant leavesautonomous vehicle10. Thecontroller34 may control parking of theautonomous vehicle10 by using thesensing devices40a to 40n and theactuator devices42a to 42n to maneuver theautonomous vehicle10 into a parking space. Theautonomous vehicle10 may use the door ajar value 47 and the sweep value 49 to park in a manner that facilitates occupant egress.Referring to fig. 2,control system81 may be embedded withincontroller34 and included inparking system100 according to various embodiments. That is, suitable software and/or hardware components of controller 34 (e.g.,processor44 and computer readable storage device or medium 46) are employed to providecontrol system81 for use in conjunction withparking system100 ofautonomous vehicle10. For example, thecontrol system81 identifies and characterizes parking spaces and controls operation of theautonomous vehicle10 based on the identification and characterization. Generally, thecontrol system81 receives vehicle location information, destination information, and sensor data indicative of the external environment of the autonomous vehicle, and determines a vehicle operating mode and provides an output. A parking position within the parking space is determined based on the parking space characteristics and the occupant position.Control system81 includes a data flow that illustrates various operational aspects ofparking system100. Thecontrol system81 may be considered to implement one or more functional subunits or modules. In various embodiments, thecontrol system81 is configured to generate control outputs and other signals. For example, as shown in more detail in fig. 2 and with continued reference to fig. 1,parking system100 includes adata store82, a target parkingspace identification module83, ascan operation module84, a target parkingspace characterization module85, aparking decision module86, and aparking control module87. As can be appreciated, themodules83, 84, 85, 86, and 87 shown in fig. 2 are implemented by theprocessor44 and may be combined and/or further partitioned to operate similarly in accordance with the functionality described herein.In various embodiments, thedata storage82 stores data regarding physical characteristics of theautonomous vehicle10, such as in the data storage device 32. For example, thelength37,width39,door opening dimension33 of thefront doors25, 27, anddoor opening dimension35 of therear doors29, 31 are stored. In various embodiments, thedata store82 stores information about seat arrangements, occupant positions, and door positions of theautonomous vehicle10. In various embodiments, the vehicle data store stores map information, such as street and parking space detail data.The targetslot identification module83 receives data such as avehicle position output88 indicating a vehicle position and avehicle destination output89 indicating a destination of theautonomous vehicle10. The targetslot recognition module83 starts operation based on the received data. For example, the targetslot identification module83 compares thevehicle location output88 with thevehicle destination output89 and when they converge, themap information90 from thedata store82 is retrieved. Through themap information90, the target parkingspace recognition module83 recognizes a parking area for searching. Thereafter, the targetslot identification module83 compares the current vehicle position, as indicated by thevehicle position output88, to themap information90 and uses thesensor output91 to steer theautonomous vehicle10 into and through the parking area via the generatedcontrol signal93. Theautonomous vehicle10 is steered bycontrol signals93, for example, by providing signals to the actuator devices 42 a-42 n and sensing devices 40 a-40 n, as described in further detail below. Targetspace identification module83monitors sensor output91 to identify unoccupied target spaces. For example, from the image camera data, it can be determined where there are free parking spaces. Once an unoccupied slot is identified, it is selected as the target slot, and the target slot identification module generates ascan signal92 that is provided to thescan operation module84. In response, thescanning operation module84 generates acontrol signal93 to move theautonomous vehicle10 to scan the target parking space, for example, by activating the actuator devices 42 a-42 n and the sensing devices 40 a-40 n. Thescanning operation module84 performs a scanning of the parking spaces, for example, by means of radar data, lidar data, and camera image data, to determine objects and free spaces on the plane of the parking space surface. Also for example, the camera image data is used to locate a parking space boundary line on the plane of the parking space.Scan operation module84 generates signals ofscan data75, which are provided to target parkingspace characterization module85.In various examples, targetspace identification module83 also generates anactivation signal94 that is provided to targetspace characterization module85. Target parkingspace characterization module85 receivesscan data75 fromscan operation module84. Target parkingspace characterization module85 processes receivedscan data75 to characterize a parking space. As described in detail below, target parkingspace characterization module85 evaluates any objects, free spaces, and parking space boundary lines to characterize the target parking space. Target parkingspace characterization module85 generatescharacterization data95, which is provided toparking decision module86. Theparking decision module86 also receives sensor data from thedata store82 indicating the position of an occupant within theautonomous vehicle10 via anoccupant position output96. Theparking decision module86 receives vehiclecharacteristic data97 from theself data store82. As described in further detail below, theparking decision module86 compares thecharacterization data95 to theoccupant position output96 and thevehicle characterization data97 to determine whether and how the parking space is used. Based on the result of this comparison, theparking decision module86 either generates a follow-up search signal98 which is provided to the target parkingspace identification module83, which again initiates the search; or generate apark signal99 provided to parkcontrol module87. Thepark control module87 generates acontrol signal93 to park the vehicle, for example, by providing signals to the actuator devices 42 a-42 n and the sensing devices 40 a-40 n, as described in further detail below.Referring to fig. 3, when theautonomous vehicle10 reaches a destination requiring parking, theparking lot60 may be searched by thecontrol system81 to obtain an available parking space, for example, from theaisle58. Available parking spaces may be identified by target parkingspace identification module83 and may be referred to astarget parking spaces62 in whichparking system100 ofautonomous vehicle10 initiates parking.Target parking space62 may be defined by alongitudinal boundary line64, alateral boundary line66, and alongitudinal boundary line68.Entrance70 may be defined as an unpainted opening intotarget parking space62.Target parking space62 may have aleft side78 and aright side80 as viewed from the perspective ofentrance70.In various examples,parking lot60 may be an open parking lot, where any available parking space may be used. For an open parking lot,autonomous vehicle10 may use sensor system 28 to scanparking lot60 to identify parking spaces that are free of other vehicles and any obstacles that would prevent its use. In other examples,parking lot60 may be a managed parking lot in which parking spaces are allocated. Parking spaces may be pre-assigned for individual users, or they may be assigned upon (vehicle) entry. For example, theautonomous vehicle10 may communicate with the management system 61 of theparking lot60 via thecommunication system36. The management system 61 may assign the designated parking space to theautonomous vehicle10.Referring additionally to fig. 4, upon approachingtarget parking space62, atstep102, aparking process101 ofautonomous vehicle10 may be initiated byparking system100, and this parking process may be implemented by the methods described herein fig. 4 is a flow chart ofprocess101 implemented byparking system100 for parking a vehicle according to an exemplary embodiment.Process101 may be implemented in connection withautonomous vehicle10, for example, byparking system100 includingcontrol system81, as well as other systems, subsystems, and components of the parking system, including any of those described in fig. 1 and 2.Process101 is also described below in conjunction with fig. 1-12, which depict illustrative vehicle parking system details and activities in accordance with exemplary embodiments.As depicted in fig. 4, theprocess101 includes a start or startstep102. For example, in various embodiments, theprocess101 may be initiated when theautonomous vehicle10 reaches a destination that requires parking. As mentioned above, the initiation may be accomplished by parkingspace identification module83. In this embodiment, theprocess101 continues until theautonomous vehicle10 is parked. It should be understood that theprocess101 may use other processes of theautonomous vehicle10 that are initiated before or afterstep102, and/or may use other data collected before or afterstep102. For example, the physical dimensions of theautonomous vehicle10, including the dimension values 45 stored in thedata storage82 of the data storage device 32, may be referenced. As another example, reference may be made to the sensed door ajar value 47 stored in thedata store82 of the data storage device 32. In various embodiments, any driver selection of a gap may be recorded for parking purposes. For example, in certain embodiments, a vehicle occupant may be provided with a choice for a preferred amount of clearance. This may be accomplished when the occupant prefers some different clearance level over a default amount sufficient to exit the vehicle through the open doors. In various examples, the selections may be presented and stored indata store82 of data storage device 32 of fig. 1 for use in assessing the sufficiency oftarget parking space62.Atstep104, theautonomous vehicle10 may operate in theaisle58 of theparking lot60, searching for available parking spaces. This search may result in the identification oftarget parking space62 by target parkingspace identification module83. Atstep106, scanningoperation module84 then directsautonomous vehicle10 to scantarget parking spot62 fromlane58 to receive sensor data indicative of the external environment of the autonomous vehicle. This scanning may include proceeding alongentrance70 oftarget parking space62 as shown in fig. 5, and the size oftarget parking space62 may be determined using sensor system 28. During the scanning process,autonomous vehicle10 may proceed in a forward operation from a position wheretarget parking space62 of fig. 3 is substantially forward ofautonomous vehicle10 to a position wheretarget parking space62 of fig. 6 is substantially rearward ofautonomous vehicle10. Theautonomous vehicle10 may stop in theaisle58 after passing through theentrance70 at the position of fig. 6. In various examples, the position of theboundary lines64, 66, 68 may also be sensed. The position of anyadjacent vehicles70, 72 relative to those (boundary) lines can be observed and recorded. In one embodiment, the determination is made as to thenet width74 of the available net lateral parking space as indicated in fig. 3, 5 and 6. For example, any congestion or intrusion of thetarget parking space62 by any adjacent vehicle, such asvehicles70, 72, may be sensed. Thelength76 oftarget parking space62 may also be sensed. Atstep108, the generated values and determinations are provided to target parkingspace characterization module85 byscan operations module84. In some embodiments, the generated values and determinations are stored as scan values 49 in data storage device 32 of fig. 1, and subsequently provided to target parkingspace characterization module85, such as viadata storage82. Atstep108, target parkingspace characterization module85 processes the received sensor data to characterize the parking space. Also in various embodiments, the determination and classification ofstep108 may be made by thecontrol system81. For example, a target parking spot may be classified as available, meaning that no other vehicle is present in a manner that would prevent use. In another example,target parking spot62 may be classified as unobstructed, meaning that no objects are present to the extent that use may be impeded.Data is accessed with respect to various information. For example, the size values 45 for various vehicle size data are provided from thedata store82. Also for example, data collected via the sensor system 28 and stored as the scan values 49 is recalled. Inparking decision module86, size value 45 may be compared to scan value 49 atstep110, and a determination made whetherautonomous vehicle10 will match withintarget parking space62. When the determination atstep110 is negative, meaning that theautonomous vehicle10 will not match intarget parking spot62, then a continuesearch signal98 is generated byparking decision module86. Accordingly,process101 may return to step 104 and may continue the search for another available parking space via target parkingspace identification module83. When the determination atstep110 is positive, meaning that theautonomous vehicle10 will be matched in thetarget parking space62, theprocess101 proceeds to step 112. Atstep112,parking decision module86 determines whethertarget parking space62 has limited lateral clearance. The limited lateral clearance means that theclear width74 acrosstarget parking space62 is limited to less than the space required for occupants to comfortably evacuate through both sides ofautonomous vehicle10 when parking them intarget parking space62. For example, the total width may be assigned by the layout of the parking lot as determined by thedistance79 between thelongitudinal boundary lines64 and 68, as shown in fig. 5. The parking lot layout may assume that the gaps of open doors include somespaces77 as indicated in fig. 6, thespaces77 existing on thelongitudinal boundary lines64 and 68 where theadjacent vehicles70 and 72 are centered in their slots.Target parking spot62 is determined to have limited lateral clearance, such as when it is crowded with adjacent vehicles or is intruded. For example, theentire distance79 may not be available, or theentire distance79 with a portion of thespace77 may not be available. In other examples, there is limited lateral clearance when the distance betweenadjacent vehicles70 and 71 (or other objects) is below a threshold necessary to freelyopen doors25, 27, 29 or 31 as needed for occupant egress. When a negative determination is made atstep112, meaning that the width/lateral gap is unlimited,process101 may proceed to step 114 and, viapark control module87,autonomous vehicle10 may park in a parking position withintarget parking space62. In many examples, the parking position is centered betweenboundary lines64 and 68. Once the vehicle is parked, the occupant may exit theautonomous vehicle10 and theprocess101 ends atstep128.When a positive determination is made atstep112, which means that the lateral clearance of thetarget parking space62 is limited, the process may proceed to step 116 and the parking position within thetarget parking space62 is determined based on the parking space characteristics and the occupant position. Thepark decision module86 receives sensor data indicative of the position of an occupant within the autonomous vehicle. For example, the recorded door ajar value 47 (or other occupant position data) may be provided by thedata store82. Proceeding to step 118,controller34, and more specificallyprocessor44, throughparking decision module86, determines which ofdoors25, 27, 29, 31 is to be opened for an occupant exitingautonomous vehicle10. For example, if door ajar value 47 indicates thatdoors25 and 27 are open when an occupant entersautonomous vehicle10,parking decision module86 may infer thatdoors25 and 27 are to be open for an occupant exitingautonomous vehicle10. In various examples, theprocess101 may assume that occupants of therear seats53, 54 may exit theautonomous vehicle10 from either side. Thus, if door ajar value 47 indicates thatdoor29 and/or 31 is open when an occupant entersautonomous vehicle10,controller34 may infer thatdoor29 or 31 will be open for an occupant exitingautonomous vehicle10. When thepark decision module86 determines that only one of thedoors29, 31 is to be used for egress and the rear door on the opposite side of the vehicle is to be used for ingress, the occupant of therear seat21 or 23 may be requested to exit from the opposite side.Parking control module87 may signalcommunication system36 to communicate with occupants of the vehicle. For example, an occupant of the rightrear seat23 may be required to exit through the leftrear door29. This assumes that the rear seat occupant may slide across theautonomous vehicle10 due to the absence of an obstacle such as a console. In vehicles where an obstacle does exist, the use of the opposite side door may be omitted. In many examples, this decision may be ignored by the occupant, in which case theprocess101 will continue based on the override and use the samerear doors29, 31 as those used for entry for exit.Process101 may proceed to step 120 whereparking decision module86 determines whethertarget parking space62 has limited lateral clearance on both sides ofautonomous vehicle10, as shown in fig. 7. For example, this means that when theautonomous vehicle10 is in thetarget parking space62, the doors on both sides cannot be properly opened, so that the occupant cannot exit from either side. When a positive determination is made thattarget parking spot62 has limited lateral clearance on both sides ofautonomous vehicle10,process101 may proceed to step 122. Atstep122, prior to parking, theautonomous vehicle10 is parked in thetunnel58 and the occupant is released, as shown in fig. 7, in response to theparking control module87. For example,parking control module87 may signalcommunication system36 to deliver a message requesting that the occupant come fromhost vehicle10. Alldoors25, 27, 29, 31 can be opened. Once the occupant has exited and emptied the vehicle,process101 may proceed to step 114, andparking control module87 may controlautonomous vehicle10 to automatically park intarget parking space62 at the parking location with limited lateral clearance on both sides, as shown in fig. 8. For example,parking control module87 operates one or more actuator devices 42 a-42 n to maneuver an autonomous vehicle intotarget parking space62. Theautonomous vehicle10 stops and parks within theboundary lines64, 66, and 68. In various examples, theautonomous vehicle10 may park centrally in thetarget parking space62 between theadjacent vehicles70 and 72.When a negative determination is made atstep120, meaning thattarget parking space62 has only limited lateral clearance on oneside78 or 80,process101 may proceed to step 124. Atstep124, thepark decision module86 determines whether an occupant is present in any of thefront seats15 and/or 17 of theautonomous vehicle10. In this example, the question is whether any one or both of the front seats are occupied. When the determination is negative and there is only a passenger in the rear seat, theprocess101 may proceed to step 114 and thepark control module87 parks theautonomous vehicle10 at the park position with the offset, such as shown in fig. 12.Parking control module87 operates one or more actuator devices 42 a-42 n to maneuver the autonomous vehicle intotarget parking space62. Theautonomous vehicle10 may be parked closer to theboundary line68 than theboundary line64. Thedoor29 can be freely opened and the rear seat passenger can exit.Parking control module87 may signalcommunication system36 to request all rear seat passengers to exit through leftrear door29. Once the occupant has evacuated theautonomous vehicle10 and closed the doors, theprocess101 may end atstep128.Returning to step 124, when the determination is affirmative and a front seat occupant is present, theprocess101 may proceed to step 126. Atstep126, thepark decision module86 determines whether the occupant is present at both the leftfront seat15 and the rightfront seat17. For example, the door ajar value 47 may be recalled to indicate which sides of theautonomous vehicle10 have occupants. When the determination atstep126 is negative, meaning that no occupant is present in either front seat, or meaning that an occupant is present in only one front seat, then the process may proceed to step 114 andpark control module87 parksautonomous vehicle10 intarget parking space62 at the parking position with a lateral offset as shown in fig. 11, such that the rear seat occupant and one front seat occupant are away. In the example of fig. 11, here the frontright seat17 is occupied and theautonomous vehicle10 is parked closer to thelongitudinal boundary line64 than to thelongitudinal boundary line68. The parking offset towardline64 provides a space to the right 80 oftarget parking space62. One or both of thedoors27, 31 may be opened for occupant egress. In another example, a limited clearance may exist onleft side78 oftarget parking spot62 and the occupant may be located on the left side ofautonomous vehicle10, whether in the front left seat, the rear left seat, or both the front left seat and the rear left seat. Parking control module signals operation of one or more actuator devices 42 a-42 n to maneuverautonomous vehicle10 intotarget parking space62. For example, a self-exiting vehicle may proceed in reverse of the position of FIG. 3 and then entertarget parking space62 in a forward maneuver. In this example,autonomous vehicle10 may park as shown in fig. 10, with the offset intarget parking space62 being towardline68 becauseadjacent vehicle70 is the cause of the limited clearance. The occupant may exit through one or both of thedoors25, 29. Once the occupant has evacuated theautonomous vehicle10 and closed the doors, theprocess101 may end atstep128.Returning to step 126, when the determination is positive and a front seat occupant is present in bothseats15 and 17,process101 may proceed to step 122. Atstep122, theautonomous vehicle10 releases the occupant prior to parking, as shown in fig. 7. For example, under the control ofpark control module87,autonomous vehicle10 may be parked in place inaisle58.Parking control module87signals communication system36 to deliver a message requesting that the occupant leaveautonomous vehicle10. Once the occupant has evacuated and emptied the vehicle,process101 proceeds to step 114 andpark control module87 controlsautonomous vehicle10 to park at the parking location intarget parking space62. The park control module generates signals for operation of one or more actuator devices 42 a-42 n to maneuverautonomous vehicle10 intotarget parking space62. Once theautonomous vehicle10 is parked and stopped, theprocess101 may end atstep128.In some embodiments, when it is determined that there is limited lateral clearance such that an occupant will be able to exit from only one side of the vehicle and that occupants are present on both sides of the vehicle, the occupant may be given the option of exiting in thetunnel58 or from one side in thetarget parking spot62. For example, this means that when theautonomous vehicle10 is in thetarget parking space62, the doors on both sides cannot be opened properly so that the occupant cannot exit from either side. In these embodiments, in response toparking control module87,autonomous vehicle10 is parked inaisle58, such as atstep122.Parking control module87 may signalcommunication system36 to deliver a message asking the occupants whether they wish to exitautonomous vehicle10 from the opposite side inlane58 or from the same side intarget parking space62. The occupant is prompted to make a selection, such as via a voice response or selector input. If exit in the aisle is selected, once the occupant has exited and emptied the vehicle,process101 may proceed to step 114 andparking control module87 may controlautonomous vehicle10 to automatically park at the parking location intarget parking space62. If the departure from one side intarget parking space62 is selected,autonomous vehicle10 parks in an offset, such as shown in FIG. 10. For example, the occupant is prompted to exit through the left side of the vehicle. The occupant exits through one or both of thedoors25, 29. Once the occupant has evacuated theautonomous vehicle10 and closed the doors, theprocess101 may end atstep128.Table 1 provides a summary of examples of the results ofprocess101 for various door ajar and limited clearance combinations. Results 1 and 2 are shown. Result 1 means that theautonomous vehicle10 is parked in thetarget parking space62 with a lateral offset. Result 2 means that the occupant is released inaisle58 and thenautonomous vehicle10 is parked intarget parking spot62. For example, when door ajar value 47 indicates that one or more doors are open to load the occupant on either the right or left side (right or left), and there is limited clearance on one side oftarget parking space62, then result 1 is generated. This means that theautonomous vehicle10 is parked in thetarget parking space62 with a lateral offset. In another example from table 1, when door ajar value 47 indicates that one or more doors are open to load the occupant on both the right and left sides (right or left), and there is a finite gap on both sides oftarget parking space62, then result 2 is generated. This means that the occupant is released in theaisle58 and subsequently theautonomous vehicle10 is parked in thetarget parking space62.TABLE 1Thus, when parking with a lateral offset for result 1, the occupant will exit from the left or right side of theautonomous vehicle10 and park at an offset relative tolines64 and 68. For example, the occupant may be located at one or both of theleft seats15, 21 of theautonomous vehicle10. As shown in fig. 9, thevehicle72 may be responsible for limited lateral clearance to the right.Autonomous vehicle10 may park with an offset to line 64 to the left oftarget parking spot62. For result 2, theautonomous vehicle10 releases its occupant before stopping. Because thedoors25, 27, 29, 31 do not need to be opened after parking, theautonomous vehicle10 may be parked at or near the center of thetarget parking space62.With regard to parking from the aisle position of fig. 6 or 7, the parking control module effects a reverse operation of theautonomous vehicle10 to the position of fig. 3, and then performs a forward operation to enter the target parking space and park forward as shown in fig. 8. In other examples,autonomous vehicle10 may be operated to move fromaisle58 intotarget parking spot62 in reverse operation and reverse park as shown in fig. 9. In some examples, reverse parking may be employed as a driver preference and as a storage selection configuration in thedata store82. In other examples, reverse parking may also be employed bycontrol system81. If reverse parking is not employed,autonomous vehicle10 is operated in reverse from the position of FIG. 6 or FIG. 7 to the position of FIG. 3, and then enterstarget parking space62 in forward operation. In other examples, the direction of forward, reverse parking may be communicated from a parking lot management system, or determined based on which side oftarget parking space62 is restricted as described herein.Parking ofautonomous vehicle10 withintarget parking space62 with limited clearance is accomplished viaparking system100 andprocess101. The autonomous vehicle may park at an offset withintarget parking space62.

No. 14/500,750, filed Sep. 29, 2014, and is entitled to that filing date for priority. The specifications, figures, and complete disclosures of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/500,750 and Ser. No. 15/496,338 are incorporated herein in their entireties by specific reference for all purposes.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to telematics systems, methods and apparatus that enable two-way communication between vehicles in a fleet and a fleet management system. The invention enables telematics components in vehicles within a fleet to be programmed so that different functionality can be provided to different vehicles in the fleet. Moreover, the programming for a given vehicle can be changed at different points in time, thereby enabling a single vehicle in the fleet to be utilized in multiple vehicle programs at different points in time, with appropriate functionality for the each program being provided by the telematics components.BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONNearly all vehicles now include sensors and computer systems for monitoring the operational status and performance of vehicle systems and components. Some vehicles also include telematics units for capturing sensor data and system information, and for communicating such data and information to an outside data center. However, existing systems have numerous limitations. For example, some systems avoid the use of cellular communication capability due to the cost of cellular data transmission, the complexity of incorporating such technology into each vehicle in the fleet, and the power requirements associated with such communication capability.Prior systems seek to overcome these difficulties by using limited distance RF communication capability instead of cellular communication capability. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,370,268 describes a system where telematics data is communicated from a vehicle to a central database via a transmitter/receiver in the vehicle and sensors positioned around a facility. Such system includes only medium range communication capabilities, and does not enable communication with the vehicle when it is located outside of the facility. Likewise, U.S. Pat. No. 7,356,494 is directed at a wireless communication system which employs separately installed wireless infrastructure with storage and processing capability. This system enables a wireless device in the vehicle to communicate locally with the wireless infrastructure, which thereafter communicates on a periodic basis with the management system. In this system, the vehicles communicate only when positioned near the intelligent wireless infrastructure, and the cost of installing and maintaining the wireless infrastructure is prohibitive.Additional systems in the marketplace require complex installation, such as manual hardwiring of the telematics unit to sensors and systems in each vehicle. Unfortunately, the time and labor required for such manual installation makes it prohibitively expense and impractical for use in a fleet of vehicles, particularly where the fleet contains different vehicle makes and models and where the fleet vehicles are being replaced every two or three years.The technology described in prior systems also does not allow a fleet owner to readily manage vehicle operations where data collection and vehicle system functionality differ from one fleet vehicle to another fleet vehicle, or where different data collection and vehicle system functionality is required in a single vehicle at different points in time. This means that current technologies do not enable a fleet owner to manage a fleet where fleet vehicles can participate in multiple vehicle programs.SUMMARY OF INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to methods, systems and apparatus for communicating data and information between a vehicle and a fleet management system. The invention employs a telematics control unit (“TCU”) installed in the vehicle and connected to the On Board Diagnostics II port (“OBD II”) of the vehicle. By connecting the TCU to the OBD II port, the TCU is able to be powered by vehicle energy sources. Further, the OBD II connection enables the TCU to receive data and information from existing vehicle sensors and computing systems. This connection ability enables the TCU to be easily and quickly installed as an after-market device in fleet vehicles, without the need for time-consuming manual direct wiring of the TCU to vehicle sensors and systems, including the controller area network (“CAN bus”).Direct connection of the TCU to the OBD II port enables the TCU to communicate through the OBD II port with OEM installed sensors, electronics and operating systems, thereby enabling the TCU to engage in two-way communications with certain existing vehicle components. When installed in a vehicle, and programmed for operation in connection with the specific vehicle and OBD II device to which it is connected, the TCU may execute specific actions within a vehicle, such as activating vehicle systems and components including the lights, hom and door locks, etc. The TCU can also be programmed to disable or deactivate certain vehicle systems and components, such as the vehicle ignition or starter. This capability is very useful where the vehicle may be used by different people in different vehicle programs, such as a rental program, a sharing program and corporate or municipal fleet program.The TCU of the present invention includes hardware and software that enables it to engage in two-way data communication with a remote fleet management system via existing cellular telephone networks. Two-way cellular communication enables the management system to receive data and information directly from the TCU, and to transmit data and information directly to the TCU wherever the vehicle is located. This makes it simple for the management system to transmit firmware updates and software necessary for operation of the TCU. Two-way cellular communication further enables the management system to determine whether correct and complete programming information has been received by the TCU and to receive, on a continuous or periodic basis, operating data and information from the vehicle. Since the communication hardware and software is part of the TCU, the TCU can also communicate with the management system when, for example, the TCU is disconnected or removed from the vehicle.The connection of the TCU to the vehicle OBD II port enables the TCU to read the vehicle VIN, and transmit the vehicle VIN, so that the fleet management system can associate the TCU with a specific vehicle. Once this information is received by the management system, firmware and software updates necessary for proper operation of the TCU with that particular vehicle can be transmitted from the management system to the TCU. As long as the management system contains programming for each make and model vehicle in a fleet, the TCU can be used on any vehicle in the fleet. Further, the device can be easily removed from one vehicle and reinstalled in another fleet vehicle at a later point in time. Once the TCU is reinstalled, the fleet management system can update the firmware and software so that the TCU is appropriately configured for the second (or subsequent) vehicle. Further, the TCU can be programmed to detect and report removal from the OBD II port of the vehicle, meaning that the management system can detect unauthorized action or tampering with the TCU.The ease with which the TCU may be programmed or reprogrammed by the fleet management system provides many advantages. In addition to changing the programming when the TCU is installed in a subsequent vehicle, the TCU programming may be changed at different points in time, such that the TCU can operate in different operational “modes” in a single vehicle at different points in time. For example, in one mode, the TCU may be programmed to operate in a certain manner, permitting or prohibiting certain vehicle actions, and transmitting certain vehicle data and information at specific time intervals. In a different mode, the TCU may permit different vehicle actions, transmit different vehicle data and information, or transmit the vehicle data and information at different time intervals (or, for example, upon the occurrence of a specific event). This enables a single vehicle to be utilized in multiple fleet programs, such as a fleet rental program, a fleet sharing program, a corporate vehicle program or a municipal vehicle program. In each mode, different operations could be permitted, with different data and information transmitted to and from the management system. The fleet management system can set the vehicle mode by notifying the TCU and transmitting the applicable programming, meaning that a vehicle could be switched from one fleet or program to another fleet or program at a preselected time, or upon command by an administrator. The change from one mode to another would be actuated by commands transmitted to the TCU. The TCU may also be preprogrammed to automatically change modes in response to certain actions, such as where a vehicle is accessed with a designated card key or an access code transmitted via a wireless device, such as a mobile phone.Depending on the vehicle mode, the TCU may control certain vehicle functions differently, such as methods for vehicle access. The mode may also control the vehicle data transmitted to the fleet management system, including the time for such transmission. For example, the TCU may be programmed to transmit data and information relevant to the current mode automatically upon the occurrence of certain events, such as upon vehicle access, upon movement of a vehicle, or at the start or conclusion of a rental or sharing period.Additional advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description and claims which follow. It should be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not meant to be restrictive.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein and constitute part of this specification, illustrate embodiments and together with the description, serve to explain the system, methods and apparatus of the invention.FIG. 1is an exemplary depiction of a TCU in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 2is an exemplary depiction of a TCU installed in a vehicle in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 3is an exemplary depiction of a network environment including a vehicle, a TCU, and a fleet management system, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 4is a flow chart of an exemplary method of operation pertaining to a vehicle in rental mode in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 5is a flow chart of an exemplary method of operation pertaining to a vehicle in sharing mode in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 6is a flow chart of an exemplary method of installing a TCU.FIG. 7is a flow chart of an exemplary method of re-installing a TCU.FIGS. 8A and 8Billustrate data transmission of an exemplary mode of operation.FIG. 9is a flow chart depicting command-response communication in one mode of operation.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTSIt is to be understood that the system, methods and apparatus of the present invention are not limited to specific components, network connections, or arrangements described and disclosed herein, as such may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.As used in the specification and the claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Further, the terms “additional”, “optional”, “optionally”, “may” and the like mean that the subsequently described operation, event or functionality mayor may not be required, and that the description includes instances where said operation, event or functionality occurs and instances where it does not. The word “comprise” and variations of that word, and the word “include” and variations of that word, mean “including but not limited to,” and are not intended to exclude, for example, other components, steps, or operations. “For example” and “exemplary” mean “an example of” and are not intended to convey an ideal embodiment.The system, methods and apparatus of the present invention include a programmable TCU for installation in a vehicle by attaching the TCU to the OBD II port of the vehicle. The TCU includes at least one processor and a chipset for providing cellular communication capability, thereby enabling the TCU to engage in two-way data communication via existing cellular telephone networks. Through this communication capability, the TCU may identify itself and the vehicle in which it is installed to the management system, and receive programming from the management system so that the TCU may be utilized in the particular vehicle in which it is installed. Upon installation, the TCU will detect vehicle identification information, and transmit that information to the management system. The management system, or a backend or subset system networked to the management system, can thereafter select the appropriate programming for the vehicle make and model identified by the TCU, and cause the management system to transmit firmware updates and programming to the TCU so that it may be properly configured for use in the installed vehicle.As shown inFIG. 1, the TCU includes at least oneprocessor10for executing program instructions. Theprocessor10can be coupled to removable/non-removable, volatile/non-volatile system memory20andcomputer data storage60, for permanent or temporary storage of programming, and system and sensor data. The memory can store computer code, computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data. For example, and not meant to be limiting,data storage60can be a hard disk, a solid state drive, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, magnetic cassettes or other magnetic storage devices, flash memory cards, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, random access memories (RAM), read only memories (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the like. Multiple processors, and multiple core processors, can also be provided.The TCU includes I/O channels30for communication with the vehicle via the OBD II port via a connection at35. These communication channels may be one-way or two-way, enabling communication via the OBD II device with vehicle sensors, processing systems and buses. These channels provide discrete signals that control the actuations of features like door lock/unlock, activation of the horn, and enabling or disabling the vehicle starter. These channels may also be used for control of actuations not present on the OBD II port of the car, via direct or wireless connections.The TCU also includes amodem40and an associatedantenna45enabling two-way cellular communication with the fleet management system. Themodem40can comprise one or more communications components or modules, which can provide cellular or mobile data communication capability. Themodem40can operate on any frequency available in the country of operation. Although 3G or 4G capability (or better) is preferred, the type of communication can include, but is not limited to, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, 1×RTT or EV-DO, WiMAX, HSPAT, LTE and LTE Advanced standards. As an alternative, the TCU and modem could enable two-way satellite digital audio radio service via satellite communication networks.The TCU is powered by the vehicle via the OBD II port connection. As an alternative, or in addition, the TCU can include a direct12vpower connection to the vehicle power source. The TCU also includes a power supply with abattery50, to provide back-up power. The battery enables operation of the TCU, including cellular transmission of data, for a limited period of time in the event of a vehicle power loss or if the device is disconnected from the power source. The TCU is configured to sense the loss of power or data, and to determine whether that power or data loss is due to disconnection of the TCU from the OBD II port or a problem with the vehicle battery. For example, the cable between the TCU and the OBD II port can include a push-type switch on the connection plug, which would enable the TCU to determine whether the cable is plugged or unplugged, and to detect when it is unplugged. The TCU can also continuously monitor battery voltage, and can be programmed to report gradual voltage decay. The TCU can also check for power loss at the TeU power input pins, to determine whether the TCU is receiving power. Accordingly, if power loss occurs, the TCU will notify the management system that it is utilizing power from thebattery50. If the TCU reports that the OBD II cable is disconnected, the management system can thereafter determine if the disconnection of the TCU was authorized, for example where the vehicle is scheduled for servicing, or if the disconnection is not authorized. If the cable remains connected, and no voltage decay has been detected, the system can determine whether the power loss is within the TCU or within the vehicle by checking for power at the TCU input pins.The TCU may also include one or more indicator lights55, visible outside the device, to provide an indication of connection status and power. It may also include a buzzer or similar type of alarm, which can be programmed to activate when the TCU is installed, or in the event of loss of data or power connectivity. Different colors and patterns of lights can be utilized to indicate various issues with the device, and provide indications to an installer regarding success or failure of the installation.Although the TCU is primarily designed to receive data and information from existing vehicle sensors via the OBD II port, the TCU may itself includeadditional sensors65and other technology to provide additional information to the fleet management system. The TCU may include aGPS unit70, which includes a receiver that receives position information from a constellation of satellites, as is known in the GPS art. Additional technology can be incorporated into the GPS receiver to improve the accuracy of the equipment when the vehicle is located within metropolitan urban areas and in tunnels. For example, cellular triangulation, WiFi triangulation, and Bluetooth triangulation can be utilized. Data from the GPS unit can be read by the TCU and reported to the fleet management system on a continuous or periodic basis, or upon the occurrence of a specific event.The TCU may also include anaccelerometer80, such as a three-axis accelerometer, to detect and report vehicle impacts and driving habits. This sensor capability enables the TCU to set programmable thresholds, and detect and report when the accelerometer readings exceed those thresholds. The thresholds can be set to detect and report vehicle impacts, aggressive braking or acceleration, or improper handling of the TCU. Such data may be used by the management system to monitor, evaluate or rate driver behavior, to detect accidents, or to trigger maintenance on the vehicle. The accelerometer data may also be combined with incline measurements to detect vehicle towing or tampering. Such sensors may be programmed as always-on sensors in order to detect impacts, towing, etc. even when the vehicle is not in use. Sensors installed in the TCU may also include their own processor capability. Additional sensors that could be incorporated into the TCU include, for example, light sensors, occupancy sensors, motion sensors, and vibration sensors.Additional sensors and devices may also be installed in a vehicle, and directly connected to the TCU to provide additional system functionality. For example, the TCU may be connected to acard reader90installed on or in the vehicle to enable vehicle access by persons using an access card. The card reader may be installed on the windshield or in the dashboard to permit access to a vehicle without a key. The card reader can connect to the TCU via the I/O channels30, via a dedicated interface such as a serial interface or a Wiegand interface, or through a wireless interface such as Bluetooth. Other devices that authenticate a user and permit access or activation of a vehicle may also be included, including, for example, a fingerprint reader, a touch-pad sensor or keyboard, a retina scan device, a breathalyzer (or other sobriety testing devices), and the like. Additional sensors and devices that can be installed in the vehicle on an after-market basis for communication with the TCU include an occupancy sensor, a smoke detector, and sensors to detect hazardous or illegal substances. If the vehicle includes a key storage compartment or lock-box, a sensor to detect the presence of the key, or a device to control access to the compartment, may also be installed and placed in communication with the TCU.The TCU may further include dedicated short range communication capability, via a built incommunication device100. This technology will enable wireless local communication with the TCD. For example, if the dedicated short range communication technology includes Bluetooth capability, the TCU can enable keyless access to a vehicle, for example, via a Bluetooth-enabled mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. To utilize this technology, an authorized user can press a button, provide a code, or engage in other authentication schemes via a mobile device, thereby causing a wireless signal to be transmitted over a short distance and be received by the TCU dedicated short-range communication device. The TCU thereafter confirms whether the signal is valid and, if so, commands the vehicle to unlock the doors via the OBD II connection. Wireless short-range communication technology, standards and formats that can be utilized for this type of communication include, for example, Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE, ZigBee, RFID, NFC and WiFi Direct.Short range communication technology may also be utilized to monitor vehicle location at a facility or to detect when a vehicle is returned to or removed from a facility. In one implementation, the TCU may act as a transmitter (beacon), and receivers positioned around the lot receive the transmitted signal and notify the management system of the position of the vehicle using wired or wireless protocols and communication capabilities built into the facility. A receiver may also be located at the exit gate of the facility, to permit egress of authorized vehicles, and to inform the management system that the vehicle is exiting the lot. The system can also be configured such that the management system transmits contract data to a gate agent when a vehicle approaches the exit gate, such that the gate agent can check for proper identification. In an alternate implementation, the TCU can act as a receiver, which receives information from beacons positioned at a facility and transmits location data to the management system via the TCU cellular connection.Additional functionality can also be provided where the TCU includes short range communication capability. For example, a user with a Bluetooth enabled mobile device could activate vehicle components, such as flashing the lights or blowing the car horn in order to identify a vehicle in a lot. A user might also activate vehicle remote start technology remotely via a mobile device. A short-range RF enabled TCU, operating as a beacon, could be sensed by a user mobile device, and displayed on the user's device in a map showing the location of the user with respect to the vehicle, thereby assisting the user in locating the vehicle. Similarly, a short-range RF enabled TCU would permit the TCU to be located and tracked as a piece of equipment in inventory, when the TCU is not installed in a vehicle. Dedicated short-range communication capability would also enable the TCU to receive vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure and positive train control technology warnings and communications, which could be forwarded to vehicle occupants, or transmitted to the management system via the TCU.A TCU with short range communication capability would also enable peer-to-peer communication between TCUs in different vehicles. This is useful in managing a fleet of vehicles, as a TCU in one vehicle can communicate with the fleet management system via one or more TCUs installed in nearby vehicles. In this manner, two-way communication can be maintained between a vehicle and the fleet management system when the vehicle has no cellular communication capability due to malfunction or loss of signal. Through this chain of communication, the fleet management system can receive data from an out of communication vehicle and can transmit programming and instructions to that vehicle, via a nearby TCU or series of TCUs.As shown inFIG. 1, the TCU also includes adata port110. The data port enables access to the OBD II data for vehicle maintenance and diagnostic purposes, without the need to disconnect the TCU.For ease of installation and programming, all of the components of the TCU are preferably housed together in a single, rigid, tamper-resistant case designed to be securely installed underneath the dashboard of a vehicle, with a cable connection to the vehicle OBD II port. However, certain components of the TCU could be housed elsewhere without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the TCU could rely upon an accelerometer or a GPS unit located outside the TCU, including, for example, systems installed by the vehicle manufacturer. However, such configurations increase programming and installation complexity. Further, reliance on external systems and sensors make it more difficult to track the TCU and conditions associated with its transport, as these sensors could not provide data to the management system in the event the TCU is removed from the vehicle.The TCU preferably includes a single processor. However, an alternative configuration may utilize two or more processors, each programmed to operate in a different vehicle mode. For example, one processor may be pre-programmed to operate in a vehicle rental mode, while a second processor is pre-programmed to operate in a vehicle sharing mode. In a dual processor configuration, a controller should be included to activate the appropriate processing system in accordance with the active mode set by the management system or through other means described herein.The apparatus illustrated inFIG. 1is exemplary, and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of operating architecture. Neither should the apparatus be necessarily interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated therein.An exemplary depiction of a TCU installed in a vehicle is shown inFIG. 2. The OBD II is connected tovehicle sensors125and vehicle networks, such as the controller area network or CANbus130. Additional vehicle sensors, microcontrollers, a host computer, andother systems135are also connected to the CAN bus. TheTCU140receives data and information from the OBD II port through awired connection145. Since the OBD II port is connected to the CAN bus, the TCU will have access to CAN bus data, information, systems and sensors. The TCU may also be connected to external sensors and devices added to the vehicle, such as acard reader150. TheTCU140communicates viacellular data network160with afleet management system170.The TCU, interfacing with the vehicle via the OBD II port, can monitor various vehicle systems and sensors, determine vehicle conditions, and report data indicative of vehicle status and performance to the fleet management system, in accordance with TCU programming. This includes, for example, vehicle VIN, fuel level, odometer readings, vehicle battery level, door status, ignition status, tire pressure, headlight sense, window up/down status, seat adjustment status, radio station presets, operating temperatures, operating pressures, vehicle speed, engine fuel air mixtures, oil quality, wiper usage, break pad conditions, air-bag deployment, and other data from vehicle sensors and vehicle computer systems. The TCU can also receive and communicate data from in-vehicle communication devices and warning systems, such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication devices and systems and positive train control technology. The TCU can also monitor and report DTC codes (diagnostic trouble codes), and malfunction indicator lamps. The TCU also monitors and reports data derived from TCU components and sensors, including GPS data, accelerometer data, and IMEI and SIM card numbers. The TCU processor monitors all of this data and information, formats and stores the applicable data in the memory and/or data storage device, and transmits data to the management system, all in accordance with TCU programming. Transmission of data may be programmed to occur on a continuous, periodic or event-driven basis, or a combination thereof. Different transmission timing can also be set in accordance with a particular vehicle TCU operating mode. The TCU processor can also employ data compression protocols and methodologies, such as MQTT protocols, in order to limit the amount of memory required or to minimize data transmission and the costs associated therewith.FIG. 3depicts an example of a network environment employing the invention. As depicted therein,management system300includes a plurality of sub-systems including, or example,fleet management servers305, mobile andweb management servers310and reservation andrental application servers315. Each subsystem may be connected to one or more databases and processors. The management system may also include a backend system where OBD II codes and protocols associated with different fleet vehicles may be managed and stored. The management system communicates viacellular networks320andcell towers325with TCUs installed infleet vehicles330. These communication systems enable two-way communication between themanagement system300and eachTCU335. TheTCU335includes various hardware components including, for example, a processor, memory and data storage capability, sensors, and GPS technology. TheTCU335also includes I/O channels for communication with sensors installed on the vehicle outside the TCU, and means to connect the TCU to factory installed vehicle sensors and systems, such a cable that connects the TCU to the vehicle OBD II port.TCU335also includes a modem and antenna, which enables communication between the TCU and cellular networks via cellular towers. Finally,TCU335may include short range communication technology which enables local communication withmobile devices340, such as a user's mobile phone. The short range communication capability may enable the TCU to communicate with sensors positioned around a facility, and with TCUs installed on nearby vehicles as described above. Using a mobile device, an authorized person may communicate with avehicle TCU330/335and remotely initiate certain vehicle actions. Separately, an authorized person may communicate with themanagement system300via amobile device340having cellular communication technology, viacellular network connection345,350.The TCU may receive request-response commands from the fleet management system, as depicted inFIG. 9. In response to such commands, the TCU can obtain data from vehicle sensors and systems, and provide responsive data communication to the fleet management system. Where the command entails activating a vehicle system, for example, a command to flash the lights or to open the door locks, the TCU may communicate with the appropriate system or device, initiate the requested action, inform the management system that the command was executed, and confirm the status of such system after executing the command (e.g., doors are now unlocked).The TCU may also monitor sensors for event triggered actions, such as a low battery indication or a crash indication. When these indications are noted, the TCU automatically transmits a signal with the appropriate data to the fleet management system, where appropriate responses, such as scheduling the vehicle for maintenance or repairs, can be initiated.An entire fleet of vehicles may be equipped with TCUs in accordance with the present invention, enabling the fleet management system to monitor the vehicles, collect data, execute commands within vehicles, and manage the vehicle fleet. The management system can be configured as a centralized system, or a distributed system. It can be operated in whole or in part in the cloud or on a series of servers. The fleet management system can include a plurality of sub-systems, including vehicle rental reservation management, vehicle sharing reservation management, fleet management, and vehicle maintenance management.The TCU processor can control the TCU components to allow for easy integration into different types of vehicles. Therefore, although the TCU of the present invention is expressly intended for use with automobiles, it can be installed in other types of equipment such as, but not limited to, motorcycles, trucks, buses, trains, watercraft, aircraft, and the like.The processor can also monitor TCU power consumption and limit consumption of power when desirable. For example, when the vehicle is experiencing normal operations, the TCU collects and transmits data to, and receives instructions from, the management system. However, when an extended period of vehicle non-use is detected, the TCU may initiate a low-power mode where the TCU minimizes data collection, and cellular communications are curtailed in order to limit the risk of vehicle battery drain. However, even in a low-power mode, cellular communications should be initiated periodically so that the device can receive programming and related information. In the event that the TCU is disconnected from the OBD II port, the TCU may enter an extreme low power mode, for example, where it communicates with the management system solely to report that its location and an indication that it has been disconnected from the OBD II port.The TCU of the present invention may be programmed so that a vehicle can be operated in different vehicle modes. The system, methods and apparatus of the present invention enable the device to be toggled between these different modes through a number of different actions, including via pre-programmed instructions, commands issued by the management system, or in response to certain actions of an authorized person. Accordingly, vehicles equipped with these TCUs may be used in multiple fleet programs, or switched from one program to another to in response to demand. In these different modes, different vehicle operations may be permitted or curtailed. For example, the TCU may be programmed to operate in a “rental mode,” where the vehicle is available as part of a rental program. The TCU may be programmed, when a vehicle first enters this mode, such that the doors are unlocked, the starter is enabled, and the alarm is disconnected, as the vehicle would normally be located at a rental facility, controlled by the fleet manager. This vehicle may be accessed by a user holding a rental reservation, started with a traditional car key, and driven off a lot after the driver's identification is confirmed. In this mode, vehicle data such as mileage and gas levels are monitored and transmitted periodically to the fleet management system. At the completion of the rental period, when the vehicle is returned to the rental lot, the TCU may be programmed to transmit final mileage and fuel levels to the management system for invoicing/billing purposes. Completion of a rental reservation may be noted automatically when the vehicle arrives at the lot via an RF enabled TCU or via the GPS system, or manually by a lot attendant.The TCU may also be toggled to a “sharing mode.” In the sharing mode, the TCU may be programmed such that the vehicle doors are locked, the vehicle starter is disabled, and the alarm is activated, as vehicles in a sharing program are typically stored in a location that is not controlled by the fleet manager. In the sharing mode, a user may access the vehicle and enable the starter without a key, for example, by waving an access card key over the vehicle card reader. Other access methods may also be utilized. The TCU confirms that the access action is authorized by matching the received data with data transmitted by the management system to the TCU in advance of the sharing reservation period.FIG. 4shows an exemplary flow chart wherein a vehicle TCU is toggled to arental mode400. In this mode, the vehicle is stored in a rental lot, which is typically a controlled location. Here, the vehicle may be left unlocked, with the starter enabled, so that the user may gain easy access and start the vehicle. In this mode, the TCU enables theengine starter410, disables theaccess control device420, such as a card reader, and unlocks thedoors430. When the rental period begins, a user accesses thevehicle440, and starts theengine450. The TCU notes that the doors were accessed and the vehicle started and transmits this data to themanagement system460. The TCU may also inform the management system of the vehicle fuel level and odometer reading, and any other pertinent data that the system owner desires the fleet management system to collect. If the lot includes an exit agent, data may be transmitted to that agent so that the driver's identification may be checked. In the alternative, the exit gate may be opened via the local communication capability previously described. The TCU operating in conjunction with the GPS unit may also report that the vehicle is leaving the rental lot location.During the rental reservation period, data may be collected, monitored and transmitted by the TCU, in accordance with rental mode programming. At the conclusion of therental period470, for example when the GPS unit detects that the vehicle has entered a rental facility, the TCU will inform the management system of the vehicle location, and will report vehicle odometer andfuel level readings480. This data may be used by the management system when it generates an invoice for the rental contract. Once the rental period has concluded, the TCU will check whether the vehicle is to remain in rental mode, or if it is to be toggled to theshare mode490. If the vehicle is to remain in rental mode, the TCU may confirm that the doors have been left unlocked. If the doors have been locked, the TCU may automatically unlock the doors.FIG. 5shows an exemplary flow chart wherein a vehicle is toggled to and operating in a sharing mode. First, a sharingreservation500is received by the system. At the appropriate time, typically before a user seeks to access the vehicle, information about the reservation is downloaded to the TCU of the vehicle associated with thereservation505. In this manner, the user associated with the reservation can access the vehicle with a card key (or other access device) at the appropriate time, even where the TCU is out of communication with the management system. If the vehicle is being put into sharing mode, the TCU locks the doors and disables thestarter510. At the appropriate time, the TCU enables sharing mode access functions515, such as the card reader. When the assigned user seeks to access the vehicle using an appropriate access method520the reservation starts. Access to the vehicle is provided and the starter is enabled525. During the reservation period, data may be collected, monitored and transmitted by the TCU, in accordance with sharing mode programming. When the share period ends, and the user leaves thevehicle530, the TCU ensures that the doors are locked and it disables thestarter535. The TCU also transmits certain data to themanagement system540, such as vehicle mileage, fuel level and reservation start and end times. Thereafter, the management system determines whether the vehicle is to stay in sharingmode545. If so, the process is repeated for the next sharing reservation. If it is determined that the vehicle is to be toggled to therental mode550, programming associated with the rental mode is transmitted to the TCU so that vehicle operational functions, and desired TCU data collection and transmission protocols, can be initiated. Once the rental mode ends560, the management system repeats the process of determining whether the vehicle is to stay in rental mode, or be toggled to the sharing mode.A user may access a vehicle and start a share reservation via a card key, a mobile device or other technology such as a fingerprint scan or entry of an appropriate code on an access panel. Once the TCU determines that the access attempt is valid and associated with the reservation, access will be permitted. The user can thereafter drive away in the vehicle. If the access attempt is not authenticated, such as where the card key is not authorized, access will not be permitted and the starter will remain disabled. If access is permitted, the TCU will inform the management system that access was gained via the method utilized, and that the vehicle has left the storage location. If the vehicle is in a garage, the TCU may be unable to communicate with the management system because a cellular connection is unavailable. In such case, the TCU may be programmed to permit access to and vehicle operation by the cardholder associated with the received reservation information, and will report access and operation to the management system as soon as communication is re-established. If communication is not re-established within a certain period of time after access and operation begins, further operation of the vehicle may be curtailed.When a sharing reservation is concluded, the TCU will inform the management system where the vehicle is located, and will confirm that the doors have been locked. In the event that the doors are not locked, or if the trunk is left open, the TCU may be programmed to flash the vehicle lights and/or honk the horn to remind the user to close the trunk and/or lock the doors. The doors may also be automatically locked by the TCU if the car is set to remain in sharing mode and the TCU determines that they are unlocked.A vehicle TCU can be toggled into different modes in a variety of ways. The fleet management system can designate different vehicles for different programs according to demand, as reservations are taken for different programs or in advance based upon known demand patterns. For example, in New York City, business travelers utilize rental vehicles during weekdays and local residents utilize shared vehicles during weekends. In accordance with the present invention, vehicles can be toggled between both programs to accommodate this demand by designating certain vehicles for use in the sharing program during weekends, and for use in the rental program during weekdays.The fleet management system may toggle a TCU upon command, such as when a user without a reservation arrives at a facility to rent or share a vehicle. A TCU may also be toggled in response to a user action, such as when a fleet management employee with certain privileges tries to access a vehicle via the card reader. If the card holder has appropriate privileges, the vehicle may be toggled to the appropriate mode automatically by the TCU, and access provided immediately. The mode can also be changed by fleet personnel via Bluetooth or NFC enabled mobile technology. Further, the mode can be set automatically based upon the location of a vehicle via RF or cellular communication between the TCU and the facility or the management system, such as when a vehicle arrives at a location associated with a particular program.It is envisioned that the TCU could be set for additional modes, including modes not described herein. In each case, sensor data and communication appropriate for that mode may be collected and transmitted by the TCU. For example, a vehicle might be toggled for use a corporate or municipal pool for a certain period of time. In these modes, the TCU can enable (or preclude) vehicle access via an access card. Programming might not require transmission of fuel level data to the management system, as such data might not be necessary for vehicles assigned to a corporate pool for a period of time. On the other hand, a mode could be created for a specific entity wherein fuel level data is electronically reported to that entity after each use of each vehicle so that the entity can manage refueling of all vehicles in the fleet. If a vehicle is operated as part of a corporate fleet, or is operated in regions of the country or world where travel into certain areas is restricted, such as locations near a border, the TCU mode can utilize geo-fencing to ensure that the vehicle is operated only within permitted regions. In the event such programming is implemented, and a user seeks to take a vehicle to a region that is not permitted, the management system will detect this movement via the location provided by the GPS unit, and a violation of the “fenced” territory can be triggered. Further, via two-way communication with the TCU, the management system could prohibit such travel, for example, by immobilizing the vehicle if a user enters prohibited territory. Geo-fencing could be executed within the TCU, if sufficient memory and processing capability is provided, or within the fleet management system, working in conjunction with GPS data supplied by the TCU. For certain types of fleets, GPS could be used, consistent with applicable laws and disclosure requirements, to monitor or track routes taken by drivers, or the timing of certain activities, which may be essential information in a corporate or municipal program.If the vehicle is to be used outside the United States, in certain regions of the world such as the European Community, laws and current practices may require different programming. For example, in certain countries, it is essential that vehicle doors remain locked whenever a vehicle is parked. In other countries, users may access a vehicle with a card key, and subsequently access a vehicle with a key stored in a storage compartment within the vehicle. Further, collection and transmission of certain reservation data, location data, or driving habits may be restricted in certain parts of the world. By toggling the vehicle TCU to a mode created specifically for use of the vehicle in such country or region, the invention enables a fleet manager to comply with such laws and practices as needed, while not restricting the use of the vehicle to that location or program. As can be seen, use of a programmable TCU, which can operate in different vehicle modes to provide different TCU functionality at different points in time, on a vehicle by vehicle basis, enables a single fleet of vehicles to be used in a variety of different vehicle programs. This enables the fleet owner to more efficiently manage use of fleet vehicles.FIG. 6provides an exemplary flow chart showing the steps that may be undertaken to install and activate a TCU. First, the TCU is attached beneath the vehicle dashboard and plugged into thevehicle600. Next, the TCU will initiate a power on self-test605. If the device is faulty, a fault light or alarm is activated610. If the TCU passes the test, the TCU will readvehicle VIN information615. Next, the TCU transmits the VIN, together with TCU IMEI and SIM information, to themanagement system620. In the alternative, the system may check for a difference between that VIN and the last VIN on record in the TCU. If there is no change in VIN, no further action is taken.In the management system, it is determined if there is a vehicle corresponding to the VIN in thefleet inventory625. If so, the management system will associate the TCU with theappropriate vehicle630, and transmit appropriate instructions to operate the TCU in the vehicle make and model in which it is installed. If the VIN is not recognized, or if the IMEI or SIM is not recognized, the system flags the TCU data for further evaluation and notifies the installer of thediscrepancy635. Thereafter, the management system sets theTCU mode640, and notifies the installer that installation is complete645. The TCU may inform the installer that installation is complete via certain actions in the car, such as flashing the lights, changing the status of a TCU LED, or activating the car horn.FIG. 7depicts a chart showing de-installation of a TCU. When a TCU is to be disconnected, service personnel would normally inform the management system that the vehicle is going into aservice mode700. When the TCU is unplugged from thevehicle710, the TCU transmits a signal to the management system noting that it has been unplugged, along with the last VIN on record, the TCU IMEI, the current time, the battery voltage andGPS location720. The management system thereafter verifies that disconnection was intended. If so, the TCU is listed in a table of TCUs not currently installed. Where intended, the SIM associated with the TCU may be placed in an idle mode, so that further data charges are restricted725. If TCU disconnection was not authorized, the disconnection can be flagged for further action.FIGS. 8A and 8Bdepict representative data that may be communicated by the TCU upon mode switch, or as needed, respectively. As shown inFIG. 8A, a TCU may be programmed so that when it is toggled to a mode800, such as the rental mode, or the share mode, it will transmit the following data and information810: IMEI, odometer reading, vehicle battery level, fuel level, malfunction indicator lamp. The TCU can be programmed to transmit the same or different data when the TCU is first put into a new mode, depending on system needs and the data desired in such mode. As depicted inFIG. 8B, the TCU may be programmed to transmit certain data and information on an event driven basis. At850the TCU detects a new event. The TCU determines, according to TCU programming, whether that event needs to be transmitted to the management system860. If the event needs to be transmitted, the TCU sends the sensor data (including any additional data that programming requires it to send) to themanagement system870along with the TCU IMEI information or the vehicle VIN. The TCU may send additional relevant data, such as door status, ignition status, tire pressure, headlight sense, diagnostic trouble codes, and malfunction indicator lamp status.FIG. 9depicts exemplary steps undertaken by the invention in connection with command-response communications through which a user or a system administrator may remotely command the TCU to take some action. In this example, a request can be made by auser900via a mobile device in communication with theTCU905, via communication between the user and thefleet management system910, or via communication between the user and a person havingadministrator privileges915. A person withappropriate privileges915could also initiate a command via thefleet management system910or via a RF command. Once a command is initiated, it is communicated to theTCU930directly via local communication, or via acellular network connection920/925. The TCU then executes the command via the OBDII port connection940or via hard-wiredcircuit connection935. These connections enable the TCU to obtain sensor data or activate a vehicle device orsystem945, such as door locks, vehicle lights, the horn, and the like. Once the command is activated, the TCU may also confirm that the command has been activated and provide responsive or confirmation information, such as sensor data or system status to the management system. Thus, the TCU may report that the doors are locked/unlocked, the lights have been flashed, the horn activated, and the like.Command-response actions may be limited in accordance with the operable TCU mode. For example, in rental mode, users may be prohibited from activating commands, or certain administrator commands may be prohibited, such as locking of doors or activating the alarm. The fleet management system may also prohibit certain command-response actions by location. For example, a facility manager in one location may be precluded from initiating certain actions or obtaining data from a TCU in a vehicle located at a distant location.The data communicated by the TCU enables a fleet operator to manage the vehicle fleet in numerous ways. For example, sensor status and data can be transmitted by the TCU modem via the cellular network to the fleet management system where it can be accessed, analyzed, and shared with the other systems. For vehicles in a rental fleet, or when vehicles are being operated in a rental mode, ease of access can be assured, and applicable data such as fuel level and mileage can be automatically sensed and transmitted to the management system, integrated into a vehicle rental record, and incorporated into a rental invoice generated at the conclusion of a rental, without requiring a rental system employee to manually check the fuel status and mileage.Where vehicle sensors detect vehicle components requiring maintenance, such as a low battery indication, the fleet management system can interface with electronic maintenance and repair systems to schedule the vehicle for appropriate and timely maintenance or repair. The system can also ensure that no reservations are made for that vehicle during the period of scheduled maintenance. Notification of repairs needing immediate attention can also be provided to the user.If certain sensors indicate a vehicle emergency has occurred, such as a collision, the management system can detect these conditions and notify fleet administrators so that appropriate action can be taken, such as notifying authorities. In the event that an emergency is detected, GPS location data can be automatically transmitted, or requested and obtained from the TCU, so that local emergency responders can be dispatched to the vehicle location reported by the GPS system.Where accelerometer readings exceed thresholds, the TCU can communicate this information to the management system, where further analysis of sensor data can be undertaken to determine where the user has engaged in inappropriate driving behavior. If so, the management system may then flag the vehicle for physical inspection, for evidence of vehicle misuse or damage. The fleet management system may also store sensor data and other information in order to evaluate driver behavior and driving characteristics for a wide variety of purposes. For example, this data could be used for a rating system, in which future vehicle pricing or insurance coverage requirements are based upon behavior patterns noted for a particular type of vehicle, in a given location, at a given time of year. Consistent with current law and disclosure requirements, such data could be used for preferred pricing, discounts and other bonuses for drivers who exhibit safe driving characteristics. Similarly, drivers who exhibit certain behaviors may be barred from future vehicle use, or may be notified that inappropriate or improper use of the vehicle has been detected.Sensor data may also be used to monitor vehicle performance for maximizing fleet economics. Vehicle operational data and information, such as oil sensor data and fuel economy readings, may be utilized in connection with fleet vehicle maintenance. Vehicle use conditions can also be monitored such that vehicle driven in heavy traffic, or in geographic regions with excessive dust, can be scheduled for more frequent maintenance. Sensor data can also be used in connection with economic decisions, such as determining which vehicles are subject to greater abuse or higher accident rates. Such information can be used by the fleet owner in connection with vehicle use pricing decisions, vehicle and user insurance decisions, and in determining whether certain vehicles should be discontinued from a fleet.Programmable two-way communication between the TCU and the management system further enables the fleet operator to provide numerous value-added services for fleet customers. For example, for electric vehicles in a fleet, the TCU can monitor battery levels and remind a user via a mobile device when a charge is required. If so, the system may direct the user to a nearby charging location. The TCU can also report battery levels to the management system, enabling the management system to determine whether the vehicle will need to be recharged before it is provided to the next user. In sharing mode, the management system may utilize battery level information to direct the user to an available charging location at the time of vehicle return to ensure that vehicle charging takes place in advance of the next use of the vehicle. If the user cannot locate a vehicle, the TCU can be commanded to activate the car lights or the horn. In the event that a parking space is not available to a share customer seeking to return a vehicle, the TCU and/or the management system may detect the location of the user via the GPS system, and direct the user to a nearby alternate lot. The management system could also utilize vehicle GPS data transmitted through the TCU to direct a user to nearby available parking spaces during a rental or share period. The system could provide similar notification for available nearby fleet facilities, such as cleaning or maintenance facilities. Finally, in-vehicle systems such as a satellite radio system, a GPS/navigation system, or an entertainment system may be activated remotely via management system communication with the TCU, such as where there is a wired or wireless connection between the in-vehicle system and the TCU, including the vehicle CAN bus and OBD II port.One skilled in the art will appreciate that the fleet management system described herein can utilize servers and databases located on one or more computers and in storage media and devices at one or more locations, including a central computing system, such as a mainframe computing system, or a distributed computing environment where various tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. These can include public, private or hybrid cloud computing network environments. In a distributed computing environment, program modules can be located in both local and remote computer systems, and in storage media and devices. The management system can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computing devices, such as, for example, a personal computer, a portable computer, a mainframe computer, a server, a network computer, a cloud-based application or computing device, a mobile device, a peer device or another common network node, and so on.

No. 16/279,899, filed Feb. 19, 2019, which claims benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/632,012, filed Feb. 19, 2018, both of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by specific reference for all purposes.FIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to a distributed maintenance system and related methods for management of a connected fleet of vehicles.SUMMARY OF INVENTIONIn several exemplary embodiments, the present invention comprises a system using probabilistic models of failure dynamically in real time to determine and dispatch servicing, maintenance and repair services to connected fleet vehicles, particularly where the connected fleet is distributed. Servicing and maintenance of vehicle in a distributed fleet (e.g., shared vehicle or autonomous vehicle fleets, where vehicles are distributed among several possible locations between uses by a customer, member or other user) presents unique challenges compared to service and maintenance of vehicles in a more traditional hub fleet (e.g., rental fleets, where vehicles are located at a home hub between uses by a customer or other user). Because hub fleet vehicles are returned to a home hub after each rental, routine maintenance can be optimally scheduled, and identification and addressing of servicing and maintenance issues or problems can be more easily and quickly handled, typically there at the hub location itself. In addition, a fleet staff member typically has the opportunity to inspect and drive the vehicle in or between the hub lots between customer rentals, acting as an intuitive human sensor in addition to connected vehicle-based sensors and self-reporting.Vehicles in a distributed fleet do not have these advantages, as they often are subject to serial use, typically for relatively short periods of time (i.e., less than a day) with no or limited servicing between uses. In many cases, by the time a problem manifests itself, it is during use by a customer or member of the vehicle sharing service. In addition to requiring higher cost emergency servicing or maintenance to respond to the problem, and higher overall use and “churn” of fleet vehicles, the circumstances result in an unhappy or upset customer or member (and subsequent customers or members who had planned to use the vehicle with the problem), which can adversely impact fleet use and revenues. More frequent preventative maintenance decreases vehicle problems during use, but greatly increases expense due to the costs associated with shuttling the vehicle more frequently to a maintenance/repair center, lost revenues from the vehicle not being available for rent, and possible additional costs from increasing the number of vehicles in the fleet to offset the lower time of availability for each vehicle.The present invention combines self-reporting and self-management of a connected fleet vehicle (with on-board and installed sensors configured to identify actual or potential issues or problems in the vehicle, and report, request, and obtain/dispatch servicing via its cloud or network communications interfaces), and predictive failure algorithms (based on historical and current connected fleet vehicle data), with multiple probabilistic distributions for the distributed fleet to dynamically, in real time, determine and dispatch service with greater efficiency and lower costs for fleet operations.In several embodiments, each fleet vehicle possesses several probabilistic distributions, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) A distribution representing the optimal maintenance window or windows for the fleet vehicle; (b) A distribution representing likely failure modalities for the fleet vehicle, assuming no maintenance; and (c) A distribution representing likely revenues predicted for the fleet vehicle over a particular time period (e.g., the next month or 30 days). These distributions are continually or periodically updated for each fleet vehicle in the fleet management system.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG.1is an exemplary depiction of a telematics control unit (“TCU”) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.2is an exemplary depiction of a TCU installed in a vehicle in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.3is an exemplary depiction of a network environment including a vehicle, a TCU, and a fleet management system, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.4is a flow chart of an exemplary method of operation pertaining to a vehicle in rental mode in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.5is a flow chart of an exemplary method of operation pertaining to a vehicle in sharing mode in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.6is a flow chart of an exemplary method of installing a TCU.FIG.7is a flow chart of an exemplary method of re-installing a TCU.FIGS.8A and8Billustrate data transmission of an exemplary mode of operation.FIG.9is a flow chart depicting command-response communication in one mode of operation.FIG.10is a diagram of the geo-tile location determination system.FIG.11shows a view of the return and repair management portal process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.12shows a diagram of an exemplary distributed maintenance system.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTSIn various exemplary embodiments, the present invention comprises a system and related methods for management, planning and control of a connected fleet of vehicles. A “connected fleet” comprises a plurality of vehicles, some or all equipped with (i) on-board sensors and computer systems for monitoring and capturing the operational status and performance of vehicle systems and components, and (ii) one or more electronic control and/or communications units for two-way or multiple pathway communication with one or more fleet management servers or networks, outside data centers or sources, other vehicles, and individual user or driver computing devices. A “connected user” comprises a user with one or more computing devices, including, but not limited to, mobile computing devices such as smart phones, tablets, or wearable devices, that provide extended, continuous, uninterrupted electronic communications with various computer networks, devices, and systems, including, but not limited to, elements of the connected fleet computing system or network, regardless of where the user is and how they are connected. Connected users may include, but are not limited to, drivers, passengers, customers, renters, members of a vehicle sharing service, employees, owners, or operators.Vehicles in a connected fleet may include, but are not limited to, automobiles, trucks, vans, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, mopeds, construction and utility vehicles, battery-powered carts, golf carts, airplanes, aircraft, boats, watercraft, and the like. Vehicles may be controlled by a driver or user, or may be autonomous or semi-autonomous. A fleet may include, but is not limited to, a rental vehicle fleet, shared vehicle fleet, peer-to-peer or business-to-business transportation fleet, taxi-cab fleet, corporate vehicle fleet, municipal or governmental agency vehicle fleet, bus fleet, utility or construction vehicle fleet, truck fleet, or combinations thereof. A fleet may be homogenous or heterogeneous (i.e., a mixed fleet). Fleets may be combined to make larger fleets, and fleets may also be sub-divided into component fleets by various parameters (e.g., type of use, type of customer or user, country, state, city, county, or other defined geographical area). The term “fleet” as used herein includes fleets of all types and various combinations, components or sub-divisions thereof.As described in detail below, in several embodiments the present invention comprises a unique, single integrated platform for management, planning and control of a connected fleet of vehicles. The invention (or portions thereof) manages fleet planning, in-fleeting operations, vehicle acquisition and provisioning, vehicle assignment, vehicle transfers (i.e., to another fleet or another component fleet in the larger fleet), vehicle use operations (i.e., reservations, use and return by a customer, member, driver or user), vehicle servicing, vehicle maintenance and repairs, and de-fleeting operations (e.g., removal of the vehicle from the fleet, return to manufacturer, or sale to third parties).Vehicle Selection, Acquisition and ProvisioningA lead component of fleet management encompasses the planning of the mix of vehicles for a particular fleet or component of a fleet, as well as the process of acquiring a particular vehicle and then processing it for incorporation into the fleet (sometimes referred to as provisioning). These components are often referred to as “in-fleeting.”The selection of vehicles for a fleet requires consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to, acquisition cost, ease and cost of servicing, maintenance and repairs (i.e., minimize vehicle holding costs), whether the vehicle is appropriate for the intended use, whether the vehicle is appropriate for the intended market, whether the vehicle is compatible with the particular technology used by the fleet management system, whether the mix of vehicles includes a variety of vehicles to allow appropriate user choice and optimize the user experience, and whether the mix of vehicles includes “aspirational” vehicles that align with the brand image of the fleet owner or operator and maintain vehicle experience standards and user expectations.Fleet vehicles can be acquired in a variety of ways, such as, but not limited to, purchasing and leasing. In some embodiments, some or all of the vehicles in a fleet may be owned by a person or entity other than the fleet operator or owner, including vehicles that may be intermittently or temporarily available for use in the fleet, such as in a peer-to-peer to business-to-business system. Thus, for example, an individual automobile owner may make their vehicle available for use in a car rental or sharing fleet when he or she is traveling or on vacation. In several embodiments, their vehicle may already be enrolled and provisioned in the fleet, and can be easily and quickly made available for use through a variety of means as described below.Provisioning takes place after acquisition of the vehicle. This includes the addition and installation of necessary equipment and materials, as necessary, for integration of the vehicle into the fleet and subsequent use. For example, an automobile being added to a car rental or sharing fleet may be equipped with an access card reader, a telematics control unit (TCU) or similar interface or control system, an electronic toll pass unit, one or more gasoline cards, and the like. The TCU is assigned to the particular vehicle in the fleet management system, typically in an administrative unit or as an administrative function. The vehicle may be assigned to a particular fleet group or component, and assigned to one or more locations (e.g., a home location, parking spot, or the like). If the vehicle is part of a commercial car rental or sharing fleet, it may also be assigned a particular class for pricing, availability to particular users, and the like.The extent to which a particular vehicle needs particular equipment added, such as a TCU, depends upon the characteristics of the vehicle (e.g., make, model and year). Many vehicles are manufactured with a variety of integrated sensors and computer systems for monitoring the operational status and performance of vehicle systems and components, although the configuration of sensors and computer systems varies by type, model and year of manufacture. For example, modern automobiles typically comprise a plurality of vehicle sensors and systems connected, directly or indirectly, to a controller area network (“CAN bus”), with data and information available through devices plugged into a data port, such as the On Board Diagnostics II port (“OBD II”).In several embodiments, the present invention uses a programmable TCU installed in a vehicle and connected, directly or indirectly, to the CAN bus or similar vehicle network. The TCU may be directly wired to the vehicle network or components, or may be plugged into or otherwise connected to a data port, such as the OBD II port. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,635,518 (issued Apr. 25, 2017 to Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC), which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes, connecting the TCU to the OBD II port has the advantage of enabling the TCU to be easily and quickly installed as an after-market device in the fleet vehicle, without requiring manual direct wiring or connection of the TCU to the vehicle network or various vehicle sensors and systems. A TCU may be self-powered, or powered by vehicle energy sources by connection to the vehicle or OBD II port. The TCU receives data and information from existing vehicle sensors and computing systems. Sensors include internal and external sensors. These sensors and computer systems may be more complex for semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,616,896 (issued Apr. 11, 2017); U.S. Pat. No. 9,587,952 (issued Mar. 7, 2017); U.S. Pat. No. 9,517,755 (issued Dec. 13, 2016); U.S. Pat. No. 9,499,172 (issued Nov. 22, 2016); U.S. Pat. No. 9,469,307 (issued Oct. 18, 2016); U.S. Pat. No. 9,440,652 (issued Sep. 13, 2016); and U.S. Pat. No. 9,278,689 (issued Mar. 8, 2016); all of which are incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.Direct connection of the TCU to the OBD II port enables the TCU to communicate through the port with manufacturer-installed sensors, electronics, data sources, operating systems, and computing system. The TCU may thus engage in two-way communications with certain existing vehicle components. When installed in a vehicle, and programmed for operation in connection with the specific vehicle and OBD II port device to which it is connected, the TCU may execute specific actions within or through the vehicle, such as activating lights, horns, unlocking and locking door locks, and the like. The TCU also may be programmed to disable or deactivate certain vehicle systems and components, such as the vehicle ignition or starter. This capability is very useful where the vehicle may be used by different people in different vehicle programs, such as a rental program, a sharing program and corporate or municipal fleet program.In several embodiments, the TCU includes at least one processor and a chipset for providing cellular communication capability, thereby enabling the TCU to engage in two-way data communication via existing cellular telephone networks. Through this communication capability, the TCU may identify itself and the vehicle in which it is installed to the management system, and receive programming from the management system so that the TCU maybe utilized in the particular vehicle in which it is installed. Upon installation, the TCU will detect vehicle identification information and transmit that information to the management system. The management system, or a backend or subset system networked to the management system, can thereafter select the appropriate programming for the vehicle make and model identified by the TCU, and cause the management system to transmit firmware updates and programming to the TCU so that it may be properly configured for use in the installed vehicle.As shown inFIG.1, the TCU includes at least oneprocessor10for executing program instructions. Theprocessor10can be coupled to removable/non-removable, volatile/non-volatile system memory20andcomputer data storage60, for permanent or temporary storage of programming, and system and sensor data. The memory can store computer code, computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data. For example, and not meant to be limiting,data storage60can be a hard disk, a solid state drive, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, magnetic cassettes or other magnetic storage devices, flash memory cards, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, random access memories (RAM), read only memories (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the like. Multiple processors, and multiple core processors, can also be provided.The TCU includes input/output (“I/O”)channels30for communication with the vehicle via the OBD II port via a connection at35. These communication channels may be one-way or two-way, enabling communication via the OBD II device with vehicle sensors, processing systems and buses. These channels provide discrete signals that control the actuations of features like door lock/unlock, activation of the horn, and enabling or disabling the vehicle starter. These channels may also be used for control of actuations not present on the OBD II port of the car, via direct or wireless connections.The TCU also includes amodem40and an associatedantenna45enabling two-way cellular communication with the fleet management system. Themodem40can comprise one or more communications components or modules, which can provide cellular or mobile data communication capability. Themodem40can operate on any frequency available in the country of operation. Although 3G or 4G capability (or better) is preferred, the type of communication can include, but is not limited to, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, 1×RTT or EV-DO, WiMAX, HSPAT, LTE and LTE Advanced standards. As an alternative, the TCU and modem could enable two-way satellite digital audio radio service via satellite communication networks.The TCU may be powered by the vehicle via the OBD II port connection. As an alternative, or in addition, the TCU may include a direct12vpower connection to the vehicle power source. The TCU also may include a power supply (PS) with abattery50, to be independently self-powered or to provide back-up power. In the latter circumstance, the battery enables operation of the TCU, including cellular transmission of data, for a period of time in the event of a vehicle power loss or if the device is disconnected from the power source. The TCU is configured to sense the loss of power or data from the vehicle, and to determine whether that power or data loss is due to disconnection of the TCU from the OBD II port or a problem with the vehicle battery or power connection. For example, the cable between the TCU and the OBD II port can include a push-type switch on the connection plug, which would enable the TCU to detect whether the cable is plugged or unplugged. The TCU can also continuously monitor battery voltage, and can be programmed to report gradual voltage decay. The TCU can also check for power loss at the TCU power input pins to determine whether the TCU is receiving power. Accordingly, if power loss occurs, the TCU will notify the management system that it is utilizing power from thebattery50. If the TCU reports that the OBD II cable is disconnected, the management system can thereafter determine if the disconnection of the TCU was authorized, for example, where the vehicle is scheduled for servicing, or if the disconnection is not authorized. If the cable remains connected, and no voltage decay has been detected, the system can determine whether the power loss is within the TCU or within the vehicle by checking for power at the TCU input pins.The TCU may also include one or more indicator lights55, visible outside the device, to provide an indication of connection status and power. It may also include a buzzer or similar type of alarm, which can be programmed to activate when the TCU is installed, or in the event of loss of data or power connectivity. Different colors and patterns of lights can be utilized to indicate various issues with the device, and provide indications to an installer regarding success or failure of the installation. In several embodiments, the TCU may comprise an LCD or similar display screen for display of messages, alerts, or other text.While the TCU may be primarily designed to receive data and information from existing vehicle sensors via the OBD II port or otherwise, the TCU may itself includeadditional sensors65and other technology to provide additional information to the fleet management system. The TCU may include aGPS unit70, which includes a receiver that receives position information from a constellation of satellites, as is known in the GPS art. Additional technology can be incorporated into the GPS receiver to improve the accuracy of the equipment when the vehicle is located within metropolitan urban areas and in tunnels. For example, cellular triangulation, WiFi triangulation, and Bluetooth triangulation can be utilized. Data from the GPS unit can be read by the TCU and reported to the fleet management system on a continuous or periodic basis, or upon the occurrence of a specific event.The TCU may also include anaccelerometer80, such as a three-axis accelerometer, to detect and report vehicle impacts and driving habits. This sensor capability enables the TCU to set programmable thresholds, and detect and report when the accelerometer readings exceed those thresholds. The thresholds can be set to detect and report vehicle impacts, aggressive braking or acceleration, or improper handling of the TCU. Such data may be used by the management system to monitor, evaluate or rate driver behavior, to detect accidents, or to trigger maintenance on the vehicle. The accelerometer data may also be combined with incline measurements to detect vehicle towing or tampering. Such sensors may be programmed as always-on sensors in order to detect impacts, towing, and the like, even when the vehicle is not in use. Sensors installed in the TCU may also include their own processor capability. Additional sensors that could be incorporated into the TCU include, but are not limited to, light sensors, pressure sensors, heat sensors, occupancy sensors, motion sensors, and vibration sensors.Additional sensors and devices may also be installed in a vehicle and directly connected to the TCU to provide additional system functionality. For example, the TCU may be connected to acard reader90installed on or in the vehicle to enable vehicle access by persons using an access card. The card reader may be installed on the windshield or in the dashboard to permit access to a vehicle without a key. The card reader can connect to the TCU via the I/O channels30, via a dedicated interface such as a serial interface or a Wiegand interface, or through a wireless interface such as Bluetooth. Other devices that authenticate a user and permit access or activation of a vehicle may also be installed, including, but not limited to, a fingerprint reader, a touch-pad sensor or keyboard, a retina scan device, a breathalyzer (or other sobriety testing devices), and the like. Additional sensors and devices that can be installed in the vehicle on an after-market basis for communication with the TCU include, but are not limited to, an occupancy sensor, a smoke detector, and sensors to detect hazardous or illegal substances. If the vehicle includes a key storage compartment or lock-box, a sensor to detect the presence of the key, or a device to control access to the compartment, may also be installed and placed in communication with the TCU.The TCU may further include dedicated short range communication capability, via a built in communication device, such as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)device100. This technology enables wireless local communication with the TCU. For example, if the dedicated short range communication technology includes Bluetooth capability, the TCU can enable keyless access to a vehicle, for example, via a Bluetooth-enabled mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. To utilize this technology, an authorized user can press a button, provide a code, or engage in other authentication schemes via a mobile device, thereby causing a wireless signal to be transmitted over a short distance and be received by the TCU dedicated short-range communication device. The TCU thereafter confirms whether the signal is valid and, if so, commands the vehicle to unlock the doors via the OBD II connection. Wireless short-range communication technology, standards, and formats that can be utilized for this type of communication include, for example, Bluetooth, BLE, ZigBee, RFID, NFC and WiFi Direct.Short range communication technology may also be utilized to monitor vehicle location at a facility or to detect when a vehicle is returned to or removed from a facility. In one implementation, the TCU may act as a transmitter (beacon), and receivers positioned around the lot receive the transmitted signal and notify the management system of the position of the vehicle using wired or wireless protocols and communication capabilities built into the facility. A receiver may also be located at the exit gate of the facility, to permit egress of authorized vehicles, and to inform the management system that the vehicle is exiting the lot. The system can also be configured such that the management system transmits contract data to a gate agent when a vehicle approaches the exit gate, such that the gate agent can check for proper identification. In an alternate implementation, the TCU can act as a receiver, which receives information from beacons positioned at a facility and transmits location data to the management system via the TCU cellular connection.Additional functionality can also be provided where the TCU includes short range communication capability. For example, a user with a Bluetooth enabled mobile device could activate vehicle components, such as flashing the lights or blowing the car horn in order to identify a vehicle in a lot. A user might also activate vehicle remote start technology remotely via a mobile device. A short-range RF enabled TCU, operating as a beacon, could be sensed by a user mobile device and displayed on the user's device in a map showing the location of the user with respect to the vehicle, thereby assisting the user in locating the vehicle. Similarly, a short-range RF enabled TCU would permit the TCU to be located and tracked as a piece of equipment in inventory, when the TCU is not installed in a vehicle. Dedicated short-range communication capability would also enable the TCU to receive vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and positive train control technology warnings and communications, which could be forwarded to vehicle occupants, or transmitted to the management system via the TCU.A TCU with short range communication capability would also enable peer-to-peer communication between TCUs in different vehicles. This is useful in managing a fleet of vehicles, as a TCU in one vehicle can communicate with the fleet management system via one or more TCUs installed in nearby vehicles. In this manner, two-way communication can be maintained between a vehicle and the fleet management system when the vehicle has no cellular communication capability due to malfunction or loss of signal. Through this chain of communication, the fleet management system can receive data from an out of communication vehicle and can transmit programming and instructions to that vehicle via a nearby TCU or series of TCUs.As shown inFIG.1, the TCU also includes adata port110. The data port enables access to the OBD II data for vehicle maintenance and diagnostic purposes, without the need to disconnect the TCU. Thedata port110may emulate an OBD II data port, so that an OBD II device can be plugged into the TCU data port.For ease of installation and programming, all of the components of the TCU are preferably housed together in a single, rigid, tamper-resistant case designed to be securely installed inside a vehicle, typically underneath the dashboard of the vehicle, with a cable connection or direction connection to the vehicle OBD II port. However, certain components of the TCU could be housed elsewhere without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the TCU could rely upon an accelerometer or a GPS unit located outside the TCU, including, for example, systems installed by the vehicle manufacturer. However, such configurations increase programming and installation complexity. Further, reliance on external systems and sensors make it more difficult to track the TCU and conditions associated with its transport, as these sensors could not provide data to the management system in the event the TCU is removed from the vehicle.In several embodiments, the TCU or similar components may be contained in a modified ignition key, as further described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,841,987 (issued Sep. 23, 2014 to Local Motion, Inc.), which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.The TCU typically includes a single processor. However, an alternative configuration may utilize two or more processors. Where two or more processors are present, each may be programmed to operate in a different vehicle mode. For example, one processor may be pre-programmed to operate in a vehicle rental mode, while a second processor is pre-programmed to operate in a vehicle sharing mode. In a dual processor configuration, a controller may be included to activate the appropriate processing system in accordance with the active mode set by the management system or through other means described herein.The apparatus illustrated inFIG.1is exemplary, and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of operating architecture. Neither should the apparatus be necessarily interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated therein.An exemplary depiction of a TCU installed in a vehicle is shown inFIG.2. The OBD II is connected tovehicle sensors125and vehicle networks, such as the controller area network or CANbus130. Additional vehicle sensors, microcontrollers, a host computer, andother systems135are also connected to the CAN bus. TheTCU140receives data and information from theOBD II port145through a wired connection. Since the OBD II port is connected to the CAN bus, the TCU will have access to CAN bus data, information, systems and sensors. The TCU may also be connected to external sensors and devices added to the vehicle, such as acard reader150. TheTCU140communicates viacellular data network160with afleet management system170.The TCU, interfacing with the vehicle via the OBD II port, can monitor various vehicle systems and sensors, determine vehicle conditions, and report data indicative of vehicle status and performance to the fleet management system, in accordance with TCU programming. This includes, for example, vehicle VIN, fuel level, odometer readings, vehicle battery level, door status, ignition status, tire pressure, headlight sense, window up/down status, seat adjustment status, radio station presets, operating temperatures, operating pressures, vehicle speed, engine fuel air mixtures, oil quality, wiper usage, break pad conditions, air-bag deployment, and other data from vehicle sensors and vehicle computer systems. The TCU can also receive and communicate data from in-vehicle communication devices and warning systems, such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication devices and systems and positive train control technology. The TCU can also monitor and report diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) and malfunction indicator lamps. The TCU also monitors and reports data derived from TCU components and sensors, including GPS data, accelerometer data, and IMEI and SIM card numbers. The TCU processor monitors all of this data and information, formats and stores the applicable data in the memory and/or data storage device, and transmits data to the management system, all in accordance with TCU programming. Transmission of data may be programmed to occur on a continuous, periodic or event-driven basis, or a combination thereof. Different transmission timing can also be set in accordance with a particular vehicle TCU operating mode. The TCU processor can also employ data compression protocols and methodologies, such as MQTT protocols, in order to limit the amount of memory required or to minimize data transmission and the costs associated therewith.FIG.3depicts an example of a network environment in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. As depicted therein,management system300includes a plurality of sub-systems including, for example,fleet management servers305, mobile andweb management servers310, and reservation andrental application servers315. Each subsystem may be connected to one or more databases and processors. The management system may also include a backend system where OBD II codes and protocols associated with different fleet vehicles may be managed and stored. The management system communicates viacellular networks320andcell towers325with TCUs installed infleet vehicles330. These communication systems enable two-way communication between themanagement system300and eachTCU335. TheTCU335includes various hardware components including, for example, a processor, memory and data storage capability, sensors, and GPS technology. TheTCU335also includes I/O channels for communication with sensors installed on the vehicle outside the TCU, and means to connect the TCU to factory installed vehicle sensors and systems, such a cable that connects the TCU to the vehicle OBD II port.TCU335also includes a modem and antenna, which enables communication between the TCU and cellular networks via cellular towers. Finally,TCU335may include short range communication technology which enables local communication withmobile devices340, such as a user's mobile phone. The short range communication capability may enable the TCU to communicate with sensors positioned around a facility, and with TCUs installed on nearby vehicles as described above. Using a mobile device, an authorized person may communicate with avehicle TCU330/335and remotely initiate certain vehicle actions. Separately, an authorized person may communicate with themanagement system300via amobile device340having cellular communication technology, viacellular network connection345,350.The TCU may receive request-response commands from the fleet management system, as depicted inFIG.9In response to such commands, the TCU can obtain data from vehicle sensors and systems, and provide responsive data communication to the fleet management system. Where the command entails activating a vehicle system, for example, a command to flash the lights or to open the door locks, the TCU may communicate with the appropriate system or device, initiate the requested action, inform the management system that the command was executed, and confirm the status of such system after executing the command (e.g., doors are now unlocked).The TCU may also monitor sensors for event triggered actions, such as a low battery indication or a crash indication. When these indications are noted, the TCU automatically transmits a signal with the appropriate data to the fleet management system, where appropriate responses, such as scheduling the vehicle for maintenance or repairs, can be initiated.An entire fleet of vehicles may be equipped with TCUs in accordance with the present invention, enabling the fleet management system to monitor the vehicles, collect data, execute commands within vehicles, and manage the vehicle fleet. The management system can be configured as a centralized system, or a distributed system. It can be operated in whole or in part in the cloud or on a series of servers. The fleet management system can include a plurality of sub-systems, including vehicle rental reservation management, vehicle sharing reservation management, fleet management, and vehicle maintenance management.The TCU processor can control the TCU components to allow for easy integration into different types of vehicles. Therefore, although the TCU of the present invention is expressly intended for use with automobiles, it can be installed in other types of equipment such as, but not limited to, motorcycles, trucks, buses, trains, watercraft, aircraft, and the like.The processor can also monitor TCU power consumption and limit consumption of power when desirable. For example, when the vehicle is experiencing normal operations, the TCU collects and transmits data to, and receives instructions from, the management system. However, when an extended period of vehicle non-use is detected, the TCU may initiate a low-power mode where the TCU minimizes data collection, and cellular communications are curtailed in order to limit the risk of vehicle battery drain. However, even in a low-power mode, cellular communications should be initiated periodically so that the device can receive programming and related information. In the event that the TCU is disconnected from the OBD II port, the TCU may enter an extreme low power mode, for example, where it communicates with the management system solely to report that its location and an indication that it has been disconnected from the OBD II port.The TCU of the present invention may be programmed so that a vehicle can be operated in different vehicle modes. The system, methods and apparatus of the present invention enable the device to be toggled between these different modes through a number of different actions, including via pre-programmed instructions, commands issued by the management system, or in response to certain actions of an authorized person. Accordingly, vehicles equipped with these TCUs may be used in multiple fleet programs, or switched from one fleet or program to another to in response to demand. In these different modes, different vehicle operations may be permitted or curtailed. For example, the TCU may be programmed to operate in a “rental mode,” where the vehicle is available as part of a rental program. The TCU may be programmed, when a vehicle first enters this mode, such that the doors are unlocked, the starter is enabled, and the alarm is disconnected, as the vehicle would normally be located at a rental facility and controlled by the fleet manager. This vehicle may be accessed by a user holding a rental reservation, started with a traditional car key, and driven off a lot after the driver's identification is confirmed. In this mode, vehicle data such as mileage and gas levels are monitored and transmitted periodically to the fleet management system. At the completion of the rental period, when the vehicle is returned to the rental lot, the TCU may be programmed to transmit final mileage and fuel levels to the management system for invoicing/billing purposes. Completion of a rental reservation may be noted automatically when the vehicle arrives at the lot via an RF enabled TCU or via the GPS system, or manually by a lot attendant.The TCU may also be toggled to a “sharing mode.” In the sharing mode, the TCU may be programmed such that the vehicle doors are locked, the vehicle starter is disabled, and the alarm is activated, as vehicles in a sharing program are typically stored in a location that is not controlled by the fleet manager. In the sharing mode, a user may access the vehicle and enable the starter without a key, for example, by waving an access card key over the vehicle card reader. Other access methods may also be utilized. The TCU confirms that the access action is authorized by matching the received data with data transmitted by the management system to the TCU in advance of the sharing reservation period.FIG.4shows an exemplary flow chart wherein a vehicle TCU is toggled to arental mode400. In this mode, the vehicle is stored in a rental lot, which is typically a controlled location. Here, the vehicle may be left unlocked, with the starter enabled, so that the user may gain easy access and start the vehicle. In this mode, the TCU enables theengine starter410, disables theaccess control device420, such as a card reader, and unlocks thedoors430. When the rental period begins, a user accesses thevehicle440, and starts theengine450. The TCU notes that the doors were accessed and the vehicle started and transmits this data to themanagement system460. The TCU may also inform the management system of the vehicle fuel level and odometer reading, and any other pertinent data that the system operator or owner desires the fleet management system to collect. If the lot includes an exit agent, data may be transmitted to that agent so that the driver's identification may be checked. In the alternative, the exit gate may be opened via the local communication capability previously described. The TCU operating in conjunction with the GPS unit may also report that the vehicle is leaving the rental lot location.During the rental period, data may be collected, monitored, and transmitted by the TCU, in accordance with rental mode programming, as described elsewhere herein. At the conclusion of therental period470, for example, when the GPS unit detects that the vehicle has entered a rental facility, the TCU will inform the management system of the vehicle location and will report vehicle odometer andfuel level readings480. This data may be used by the management system when it generates an invoice for the rental contract. Once the rental period has concluded, the TCU will check whether the vehicle is to remain in rental mode, or if it is to be toggled to theshare mode490. If the vehicle is to remain in rental mode, the TCU may confirm that the doors have been left unlocked. If the doors have been locked, the TCU may automatically unlock the doors.FIG.5shows an exemplary flow chart wherein a vehicle is toggled to and operating in a sharing mode. First, a sharingreservation500is received by the system. At the appropriate time, typically before a user seeks to access the vehicle, information about the reservation is downloaded to the TCU of the vehicle associated with thereservation505. In this manner, the user associated with the reservation can access the vehicle with a card key (or other access device) at the appropriate time, even where the TCU is out of communication with the management system. If the vehicle is being put into sharing mode, the TCU locks the doors and disables thestarter510. At the appropriate time, the TCU enables sharing mode access functions515, such as the card reader. When the assigned user seeks to access the vehicle using anappropriate access method520, the share period starts. Access to the vehicle is provided and the starter is enabled525. During the share period, data may be collected, monitored and transmitted by the TCU, in accordance with sharing mode programming. When the share period ends, and the user leaves thevehicle530, the TCU ensures that the doors are locked and disables thestarter535. The TCU also transmits certain data to themanagement system540, such as vehicle mileage, fuel level and reservation start and end times. Thereafter, the management system determines whether the vehicle is to stay in sharingmode545. If so, the process is repeated for the next sharing reservation. If it is determined that the vehicle is to be toggled to therental mode550, programming associated with the rental mode is transmitted to the TCU so that vehicle operational functions, and desired TCU data collection and transmission protocols, can be initiated. Once the rental mode ends560, the management system repeats the process of determining whether the vehicle is to stay in rental mode or be toggled to the sharing mode.A user may access a vehicle and start a share reservation via a card key, a mobile device or other technology such as a fingerprint scan or entry of an appropriate code on an access panel. Once the TCU determines that the access attempt is valid and associated with the reservation, access will be permitted. The user can thereafter drive away in the vehicle. If the access attempt is not authenticated, such as where the card key is not authorized, access will not be permitted and the starter will remain disabled. If access is permitted, the TCU will inform the management system that access was gained via the method utilized, and that the vehicle has left the storage location. If the vehicle is in a garage, the TCU may be unable to communicate with the management system because a cellular connection is unavailable. In such case, the TCU may be programmed to permit access to and vehicle operation by the cardholder associated with the received reservation information, and will report access and operation to the management system as soon as communication is re-established. If communication is not re-established within a certain period of time after access and operation begins, further operation of the vehicle may be curtailed.When a sharing reservation is concluded, the TCU will inform the management system where the vehicle is located and will confirm that the doors have been locked. In the event that the doors are not locked, or if the trunk is left open, the TCU may be programmed to flash the vehicle lights and/or honk the horn to remind the user to close the trunk and/or lock the doors. The doors may also be automatically locked by the TCU if the car is set to remain in sharing mode and the TCU determines that they are unlocked.A vehicle TCU can be toggled into different modes in a variety of ways. The fleet management system can designate different vehicles for different programs according to demand, as reservations are taken for different programs or in advance based upon known demand patterns. For example, in New York City, business travelers utilize rental vehicles during weekdays and local residents utilize shared vehicles during weekends. In accordance with the present invention, vehicles can be toggled between both programs to accommodate this demand by designating certain vehicles for use in the sharing program during weekends, and for use in the rental program during weekdays.The fleet management system may toggle a TCU upon command, such as when a user without a reservation arrives at a facility to rent or share a vehicle. A TCU may also be toggled in response to a user action, such as when a fleet management employee with certain privileges tries to access a vehicle via the card reader. If the card holder has appropriate privileges, the vehicle may be toggled to the appropriate mode automatically by the TCU, and access provided immediately. The mode can also be changed by fleet personnel via Bluetooth or NFC enabled mobile technology. Further, the mode can be set automatically based upon the location of a vehicle via RF or cellular communication between the TCU and the facility or the management system, such as when a vehicle arrives at a location associated with a particular program.It is envisioned that the TCU could be set for additional modes, including modes not described herein. In each case, sensor data and communication appropriate for that mode may be collected and transmitted by the TCU. For example, a vehicle might be toggled for use a corporate or municipal pool for a certain period of time. In these modes, the TCU can enable (or preclude) vehicle access via an access card. Programming might not require transmission of fuel level data to the management system, as such data might not be necessary for vehicles assigned to a corporate pool for a period of time. On the other hand, a mode could be created for a specific entity wherein fuel level data is electronically reported to that entity after each use of each vehicle so that the entity can manage refueling of all vehicles in the fleet.If a vehicle is operated as part of a corporate fleet, or is operated in regions of the country or world where travel into certain areas is restricted, such as locations near a border, the TCU mode can utilize geo-fencing to ensure that the vehicle is operated only within permitted regions. In the event such programming is implemented, and a user seeks to take a vehicle to a region that is not permitted, the management system will detect this movement via the location provided by the GPS unit, and a violation of the “fenced” territory can be triggered. Further, via two-way communication with the TCU, the management system could prohibit such travel, for example, by immobilizing the vehicle if a user enters prohibited territory. Geo-fencing could be executed within the TCU, if sufficient memory and processing capability is provided, or within the fleet management system, working in conjunction with GPS data supplied by the TCU. For certain types of fleets, GPS could be used, consistent with applicable laws and disclosure requirements, to monitor or track routes taken by drivers, or the timing of certain activities, which may be essential information in a corporate or municipal program.If the vehicle is to be used outside the United States, such as in the European Community, laws and current practices may require different programming. For example, in certain countries, it is essential that vehicle doors remain locked whenever a vehicle is parked. In other countries, users may access a vehicle with a card key, and subsequently access a vehicle with a key stored in a storage compartment within the vehicle. Further, collection and transmission of certain reservation data, location data, or driving habits may be restricted in certain parts of the world. By toggling the vehicle TCU to a mode created specifically for use of the vehicle in such country or region, the invention enables a fleet manager to comply with such laws and practices as needed, while not restricting the use of the vehicle to that location or program. As can be seen, use of a programmable TCU, which can operate in different vehicle modes to provide different TCU functionality at different points in time on a vehicle by vehicle basis, enables a single fleet of vehicles to be used in a variety of different vehicle programs. This enables the fleet owner to more efficiently manage use of fleet vehicles.FIG.6provides an exemplary flow chart showing the steps that may be undertaken to install and activate a TCU. First, the TCU is attached beneath the vehicle dashboard and plugged into thevehicle600. Next, the TCU will initiate a power on self-test605. If the device is faulty, a fault light or alarm is activated610. If the TCU passes the test, the TCU will readvehicle VIN information615. Next, the TCU transmits the VIN, together with TCU IMEI and SIM information, to themanagement system620. In the alternative, the system may check for a difference between that VIN and the last VIN on record in the TCU. If there is no change in VIN, no further action is taken.In the management system, it is determined if there is a vehicle corresponding to the VIN in thefleet inventory625. If so, the management system will associate the TCU with theappropriate vehicle630, and transmit appropriate instructions to operate the TCU in the vehicle make and model in which it is installed. If the VIN is not recognized, or if the IMEI or SIM is not recognized, the system flags the TCU data for further evaluation and notifies the installer of thediscrepancy635. Thereafter, the management system sets theTCU mode640, and notifies the installer that installation is complete645. The TCU may inform the installer that installation is complete via certain actions in the car, such as flashing the lights, changing the status of a TCU LED, or activating the car horn.FIG.7depicts a chart showing de-installation of a TCU. When a TCU is to be disconnected, service personnel would normally inform the management system that the vehicle is going into aservice mode700. When the TCU is unplugged from thevehicle710, the TCU transmits a signal to the management system noting that it has been unplugged, along with the last VIN on record, the TCU IMEI, the current time, the battery voltage andGPS location720. The management system thereafter verifies that disconnection was intended. If so, the TCU is listed in a table of TCUs not currently installed. Where intended, the SIM associated with the TCU may be placed in an idle mode, so that further data charges are restricted725. If TCU disconnection was not authorized, the disconnection can be flagged for further action.FIGS.8A and8Bdepict representative data that may be communicated by the TCU upon mode switch, or as needed, respectively. As shown inFIG.8A, a TCU may be programmed so that when it is toggled to amode800, such as rental mode or share mode, it will transmit certain data andinformation810, including, but not limited to, the following: IMEI, odometer reading, vehicle battery level, fuel level, and malfunction indicator lamp. The TCU can be programmed to transmit the same or different data when the TCU is first put into a new mode, depending on system needs and the data desired in such mode. As depicted inFIG.8B, the TCU may be programmed to transmit certain data and information on an event driven basis. At850the TCU detects a new event. The TCU determines, according to TCU programming, whether that event needs to be transmitted to themanagement system860. If the event needs to be transmitted, the TCU sends the sensor data (including any additional data that programming requires it to send) to themanagement system870along with the TCU IMEI information or the vehicle VIN. The TCU may send additional relevant data, such as, but not limited to, door status, ignition status, tire pressure, headlight sense, diagnostic trouble codes, and malfunction indicator lamp status.FIG.9depicts exemplary steps undertaken by the invention in connection with command-response communications through which a user or a system administrator may remotely command the TCU to take some action. In this example, a request can be made by auser900via a mobile device in communication with theTCU905, via communication between the user and thefleet management system910, or via communication between the user and a person havingadministrator privileges915. A person withappropriate privileges915could also initiate a command via thefleet management system910or via a RF command. Once a command is initiated, it is communicated to theTCU930directly via local communication, or via acellular network connection920/925. The TCU then executes the command via the OBDII port connection940or via hard-wiredcircuit connection935. These connections enable the TCU to obtain sensor data or activate a vehicle device orsystem945, such as door locks, vehicle lights, the horn, and the like. Once the command is activated, the TCU may also confirm that the command has been activated and provide responsive or confirmation information, such as sensor data or system status to the management system. Thus, the TCU may report that the doors are locked/unlocked, the lights have been flashed, the horn activated, and the like.Command-response actions may be limited in accordance with the operable TCU mode. For example, in rental mode, users may be prohibited from activating commands, or certain administrator commands may be prohibited, such as locking of doors or activating the alarm. The fleet management system may also prohibit certain command-response actions by location. For example, a facility manager in one location may be precluded from initiating certain actions or obtaining data from a TCU in a vehicle located at a distant location.The data communicated by the TCU enables a fleet operator to manage the vehicle fleet in numerous ways. For example, sensor status and data can be transmitted by the TCU modem via the cellular network to the fleet management system where it can be accessed, analyzed, and shared with the other systems. For vehicles in a rental fleet, or when vehicles are being operated in a rental mode, ease of access can be assured, and applicable data such as fuel level and mileage can be automatically sensed and transmitted to the management system, integrated into a vehicle rental record, and incorporated into a rental invoice generated at the conclusion of a rental, thus removing the requirement that a rental system employee manually check the fuel status and mileage.Where vehicle sensors detect vehicle components requiring maintenance, such as a low battery indication, the fleet management system can interface with electronic maintenance and repair systems to schedule the vehicle for appropriate and timely maintenance or repair, as described below. The system can also ensure that no reservations are made for that vehicle during the period of scheduled maintenance. Notification of repairs needing immediate attention can also be provided to the user.If certain sensors indicate a vehicle emergency has occurred, such as a collision, the management system can detect these conditions and notify fleet administrators so that appropriate action can be taken, such as notifying authorities. In the event that an emergency is detected, GPS location data can be automatically transmitted, or requested and obtained from the TCU, so that local emergency responders can be dispatched to the vehicle location reported by the GPS system.Where accelerometer readings exceed thresholds, the TCU can communicate this information to the management system, where further analysis of sensor data can be undertaken to determine where the user has engaged in inappropriate driving behavior. If so, the management system may then flag the vehicle for physical inspection for evidence of vehicle misuse or damage. The fleet management system may also store sensor data and other information in order to evaluate driver behavior and driving characteristics for a wide variety of purposes. For example, this data could be used for a rating system, in which future vehicle pricing or insurance coverage requirements are based upon behavior patterns noted for a particular type of vehicle, in a given location, at a given time of year. Consistent with current law and disclosure requirements, such data could be used for preferred pricing, discounts and other bonuses for drivers who exhibit safe driving characteristics. Similarly, drivers who exhibit certain behaviors may be barred from future vehicle use, or may be notified that inappropriate or improper use of the vehicle has been detected.Sensor data may also be used to monitor vehicle performance for maximizing fleet economics. Vehicle operational data and information, such as oil sensor data and fuel economy readings, may be utilized in connection with fleet vehicle maintenance. Vehicle use conditions can also be monitored such that vehicles driven in heavy traffic, or in geographic regions with excessive dust, can be scheduled for more frequent maintenance. Sensor data can also be used in connection with economic decisions, such as determining which vehicles are subject to greater abuse or higher accident rates. Such information can be used by the fleet owner in connection with vehicle use pricing decisions, vehicle and user insurance decisions, and in determining whether certain vehicles should be discontinued from a fleet.Programmable two-way communication between the TCU and the management system further enables the fleet operator to provide numerous value-added services for fleet customers. For example, for electric vehicles in a fleet, the TCU can monitor battery levels and remind a user via a mobile device when a charge is required. If so, the system may direct the user to a nearby charging location. The TCU can also report battery levels to the management system, enabling the management system to determine whether the vehicle will need to be recharged before it is provided to the next user. In sharing mode, the management system may utilize battery level information to direct the user to an available charging location at the time of vehicle return to ensure that vehicle charging takes place in advance of the next use of the vehicle. If the user cannot locate a vehicle, the TCU can be commanded to activate the car lights or the horn. In the event that a parking space is not available to a share customer seeking to return a vehicle, the TCU and/or the management system may detect the location of the user via the GPS system, and direct the user to a nearby alternate lot. The management system could also utilize vehicle GPS data transmitted through the TCU to direct a user to nearby available parking spaces during a rental or share period. The system could provide similar notification for available nearby fleet facilities, such as cleaning or maintenance facilities. Finally, in-vehicle systems such as a satellite radio system, a GPS/navigation system, or an entertainment system may be activated remotely via management system communication with the TCU, such as where there is a wired or wireless connection between the in-vehicle system and the TCU, including the vehicle CAN bus and OBD II port.One skilled in the art will appreciate that the fleet management system described herein can utilize servers and databases located on one or more computers and in storage media and devices at one or more locations, including a central computing system, such as a mainframe computing system, or a distributed computing environment where various tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. These can include public, private, or hybrid cloud computing network environments. In a distributed computing environment, program modules can be located in both local and remote computer systems, and in storage media and devices. The management system can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computing devices, such as, for example, a personal computer, a portable computer, a mainframe computer, a server, a network computer, a cloud-based application or computing device, a mobile device, a peer device or another common network node, and so on. Logical connections between the computer and a remote computing device can be made via a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.Vehicle Use OperationsThe present invention further comprises one or more systems for vehicle use operations, including, but not limited to, enrolling or registering users, scheduling or reserving vehicles for approved or authorized users, monitoring the vehicle while being used, predicting vehicle arrival or return times and locations (including the identification of likely late returns), and processing vehicle returns. Types of users vary depending on the nature of the fleet. For example, users may be employees of the owner of a corporate or municipal utility fleet, authorized drivers of a bus fleet, drivers of taxi-cabs, renters or customers of a car rental agency, or members of a car sharing service. Accordingly, the types of vehicle use operation systems used above will vary as well.In several embodiments, the present invention comprises a user enrollment or registration component. This component reviews potential users backgrounds and qualifications, including, but not limited to, user training, licensure reviews, background checks, and credit checks, as appropriate. In some business models, enrollment may comprise an application and acceptance as a member of a car sharing or similar service. Advertising or other means of solicitation of potential users may be included. In some cases, users may not be previously enrolled prior to an initial reservation or use, and some or all of these checks may be performed at the time the user reserves a vehicle or initially takes possession of a vehicle. Users of a particular fleet may be divided into different categories or classifications (e.g., a preferred or frequent driver program for a car rental company, or users licensed for certain types of vehicles).The present invention further comprises a vehicle scheduling or reservation component. This comprises both user-facing and internal fleet system elements. Examples of a reservations interface for a user to identify available vehicles and make a reservation are provided in U.S. Pub. No. 2013/0226633 (published Aug. 29, 2013 by Zipcar, Inc.) and U.S. Pub. No. 2011/0060480 (published Mar. 10, 2011 by Zipcar, Inc.), which are incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.In several exemplary embodiments, the present invention comprises a multi-tiered fleet management reservations database caching system, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,576,254 (issued Feb. 21, 2017 to Zipcar, Inc.), which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes. As described therein, a database on a first computing system contains operational status data describing whether each particular object or asset (e.g., a vehicle in a connected fleet) is functionally operational, and reservation data describing the availability of that object for a reservation by a pre-authorized user, such as a member of a vehicle sharing service. A first caching level, implemented on the first computer system, creates a first cache of dense, time-windowed data by receiving, from the database, operation status data and reservation from a window or period of time, and converting the data to form windowed denser data. A second caching level, also implemented on the first computer system, creates a second cache of compact data by storing the dense windowed data from the first cache in a simple set data structure. A plurality of third caches are then created by copying the second cache, and are subsequently provided to one or more application computing systems separate from the first computer system, thereby allowing a connected end user with a computing device to access the data in a third cache without accessing the first computer system. The system is managed and updated such that the amount of time that data in the caches is different is minimized.The present invention further comprises a vehicle access component, that also may both user-facing and internal fleet system elements. This may be part of the reservations system, or work in conjunction with a reservations system. The user seeks access in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, obtaining keys to the vehicle from a car rental agent, presenting an authorized user card to a card reader in the vehicle, or using a mobile computing device to communicate with a TCU or dedicated access unit in the vehicle, as discussed above. Examples of access control systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,442,888 (issued Sep. 13, 2016 to Zipcar, Inc.) and U.S. Pat. No. 9,635,518 (issued Apr. 25, 2017 to Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC), which are incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.In cases where the user is attempting key-less access to a connected vehicle, such as by wireless communication with a user's mobile computing device, there are several methods to determine whether to allow access. In some cases, access may be permitted if the user is a pre-authorized registered user and presents a general access code or authorization to the vehicle. In other cases, reservation data (either for a single reservation or for reservations over a period of time, which can be a day or several days) has been previously electronically communicated to the vehicle (e.g., transmitted to a TCU in the vehicle) and stored therein, and access is permitted if a user attempting access matches corresponding reservation data (i.e., user identity, time period, and the like). Alternatively, after receiving an access request from a user, the vehicle (i.e., through TCU or similar unit) electronically communicates with the fleet management system to confirm whether or not to allow access. In cases where the vehicle cannot establish direct communication access, it may attempt to establish communication through other connected vehicles, through the user's mobile device, or other wireless access points.In some cases, such as an underground garage or parking area, the vehicle and user's computing device may be unable to establish outside communications links in any fashion. In several embodiments, the fleet management system of the present invention previously provides a protected, secure, single-use token to the user's computing device upon making a reservation (or close to the starting time of the reservation), which is then securely communicated to the vehicle. The vehicle processes the token and allows access if the information in the token is valid.After access is allowed, the period of use commences. During use, as described above, the connected vehicle (or a TCU or a similar unit in the vehicle) provides various types of information to the fleet management system. The fleet management system may directly or indirectly monitor some or all of the period of use.In several embodiments, the fleet management system monitors the period of use for emergency situations, which may be reported by the user through the user's mobile devices or a unit in the vehicle, or reported automatically by the vehicle through its sensors, as described above. Communications can be established directly with the user, and road-side assistance or emergency response may be called and provided. If communications cannot be established directly with the user, and depending on the information available from vehicle or TCU sensors, road-side assistance or emergency response may be automatically called.In several embodiments, the user may communicate an incident or accident in real-time during the use period. Information may be gathered in real time, including descriptions and pictures of any damage to the vehicle. This information can then be provided to the fleet management system's servicing or maintenance components for advance planning and scheduling prior to return of the vehicle.The fleet management system further provides predictive modeling to determine when a vehicle will arrive at one or more destinations or stopping points. This may be used, for example, to provide accurate determinations of when a vehicle, such as a shuttle bus, will arrive at a particular stop or terminal. It may also be used for the early detection of a possible late return of a vehicle, as described in U.S. Pub. No. 2013/0246102 (published Sep. 19, 2013 by Zipcar, Inc.) which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.Depending on the size of the fleet, tracking the location of all vehicles in the fleet requires processing an extremely large amount of data, which may exceed processing capabilities for a particular system or may unacceptably slow operational speed. In these cases, the system may actively focus on vehicles based on time and/or distance parameters. For example, the current location and speed of a vehicle may only be polled within a set period (e.g., one hour, two hours, or similar threshold) of an expected or scheduled arrival or return time. Alternatively, or in addition, the system may identify a vehicle of interest based on the relative distance from the nearest location where the vehicle may be returned, such as car rental return location.In one embodiment, the present invention uses a predictive geo-tile location algorithm to determine the distance of a vehicle from any relevant connected fleet location (such as a car rental return location), and notify the vehicle when it next needs to send location coordinates based on the relative distance from the nearest such location. As seen inFIG.10, this embodiment creates pre-determined “geo-tiles” on a map, and determines the particular geo-tile that a vehicle is in based on the most recently received GPS coordinates from the vehicle. It then determines all adjacent geo-tiles that are within a predictive search variable radius around the current vehicle location. It then determines if a relevant connected fleet location is found within any geo-tile within that radius. If so, the system determines if the vehicle is within any particular geo-fence location (e.g., a parking lot at a car rental return location). If the vehicle is found in a known geo-fenced location, appropriate return action is taken (e.g., the car rental return location is notified, and the return/check-in process is enabled). If the vehicle is not within a known geo-fenced location, the system then determines the distance to the closest fleet location, determines the next polling interval (i.e., the time when the vehicle should next send vehicle GPS location data) based on that distance, and notifies the vehicle of the polling interval. In general, shorter distances require shorter polling intervals.If no relevant connected fleet location is found with any geo-tile within the predictive search variable radius, then the system sets the polling interval to a longer period based on the size of the radius. In general, larger radii call for longer polling intervals.The present invention further comprises vehicle return applications or components, which handle, among other things, determination of the vehicle status and condition, invoicing of the user (where appropriate), and forwarding of the vehicle for any servicing, maintenance or repairs that may be required. These also may comprise user-facing and internal fleet elements.In several embodiments, the system comprises a vehicle return application or component, which can take the form of an application on a mobile computing device, such as that described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/934,887, filed Mar. 23, 2108, which is incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes. The return application is used to process the return of a fleet vehicle, including the detecting and recording (such as by digital images or videos) of damage to the vehicle (internal or external), and the need for maintenance of one or more vehicle components or systems. The user can indicate specific external damage locations on a diagram, and can interactively choose the components damaged. In some embodiments, a smart vehicle detection and recording process is used. Incident or accident reports can be digitally recorded, in order to avoid the rekeying of data where possible.In several embodiments, the system may automatically, in real time, calculate a damage charge to add the user or customer's invoice at the time of return. The mobile device may be used to capture the electronic signature of the customer or user returning the vehicle, including the damage charge. A receipt can be emailed to the customer. The system then performs, in real time, an automated comparison of the vehicle condition against an established vehicle standard or standards, such as, but not limited to, a vehicle rentable standard or a vehicle operating standard. When the established vehicle standard is not met, the vehicle is automatically placed “out of service.” If a rental fleet vehicle, for example, the vehicle then cannot be rented.The system then performs, in real time, an automated comparison of the vehicle condition against an established vehicle standard or standards, such as, but not limited to, a vehicle rentable standard or a vehicle operating standard. When the established vehicle standard is not met, the vehicle is automatically placed “out of service.” If a rental fleet vehicle, for example, the vehicle then cannot be rented. The system may then automatically direct the vehicle to servicing, maintenance or repair, as necessary, based on the vehicle condition information.Vehicle Servicing, Maintenance and RepairIn several embodiments, the present invention comprises a servicing scheduling component, which provides servicing staff with schedules or task lists of various services that are required for one or more vehicles. The servicing staff member notifies the system when the task or tasks for a particular vehicle have been completed. In several embodiments, a maintenance application receives information from the return application identifying maintenance or repair issues. In additional embodiments, the maintenance application allows the capture of maintenance and/or damage problems or issues that arise outside of vehicle rental or use, and thus would not be captured by the vehicle return process.The system then automatically creates a repair or maintenance order based on the vehicle condition information (including information gathered upon vehicle return, if applicable). The system may automatically direct a repair to the most cost effective supplier based on the total cost and other parameters of the repair, including, but not limited to, repair time, logistics, expenses, and similar factors.A vehicle repair may be managed through the repair management portal (as seen inFIG.11). The system allows users to obtain quotes for work, review and execute work and purchase orders, review and approve invoices (including e-invoices), evaluate supplier performance, and perform similar tasks. The system can prepare and display a prioritized “to-do” list of maintenance and repair tasks, and track all work performed and completed (including, but not limited to, a post-repair or post-maintenance inspection). Documentation of system tasks and functions is maintained automatically.In several embodiments, the system can automatically decide the order of repair or maintenance (e.g., what gets repaired, when it gets repaired, and how it gets repaired). The system also can interact with business operation systems (such as a rental fleet management reservation system) to tactically address and possibly release additional vehicles at peak times as needed.The system of the present invention thus provides the ability to track vehicle condition at each vehicle movement or check-points, and helps avoid missed damage and damage charges. It avoids the manually-intensive and inefficient rekeying of incident and damage details multiple times, thereby providing an efficient system to track and manage vehicle damage repair. It speeds the overall repair process, particularly removing inefficiencies caused by delayed handover of vehicles to various members of the supply chain. It further provides a consistent standard for vehicle rental or operating condition, which can be automatically determined, resulting in an improved customer experience.Distributed Fleet Vehicle Servicing, Maintenance and RepairIn several exemplary embodiments, the present invention comprises a system using probabilistic models of failure dynamically in real time to determine and dispatch servicing, maintenance and repair services to connected fleet vehicles, particularly where the connected fleet is distributed. Servicing and maintenance of vehicle in a distributed fleet (e.g., shared vehicle or autonomous vehicle fleets, where vehicles are distributed among several possible locations between uses by a customer, member or other user) presents unique challenges compared to service and maintenance of vehicles in a more traditional hub fleet (e.g., rental fleets, where vehicles are located at a home hub between uses by a customer or other user). Because hub fleet vehicles are returned to a home hub after each rental, routine maintenance can be optimally scheduled, and identification and addressing of servicing and maintenance issues or problems can be more easily and quickly handled, typically there at the hub location itself. In addition, a fleet staff member typically has the opportunity to inspect and drive the vehicle in or between the hub lots between customer rentals, acting as an intuitive human sensor in addition to connected vehicle-based sensors and self-reporting.Vehicles in a distributed fleet do not have these advantages, as they often are subject to serial use, typically for relatively short periods of time (i.e., less than a day) with no or limited servicing between uses. In many cases, by the time a problem manifests itself, it is during use by a customer or member of the vehicle sharing service. In addition to requiring higher cost emergency servicing or maintenance to respond to the problem, and higher overall use and “churn” of fleet vehicles, the circumstances result in an unhappy or upset customer or member (and subsequent customers or members who had planned to use the vehicle with the problem), which can adversely impact fleet use and revenues. More frequent preventative maintenance decreases vehicle problems during use, but greatly increases expense due to the costs associated with shuttling the vehicle more frequently to a maintenance/repair center, lost revenues from the vehicle not being available for rent, and possible additional costs from increasing the number of vehicles in the fleet to offset the lower time of availability for each vehicle.The present invention combines self-reporting and self-management of a connected fleet vehicle (with on-board and installed sensors configured to identify actual or potential issues or problems in the vehicle, and report, request, and obtain/dispatch servicing via its cloud or network communications interfaces), and predictive failure algorithms (based on historical and current connected fleet vehicle data), with multiple probabilistic distributions for the distributed fleet to dynamically, in real time, determine and dispatch service with greater efficiency and lower costs for fleet operations.In several embodiments, each fleet vehicle possesses several probabilistic distributions, including, but not limited to, the following:a. A distribution representing the optimal maintenance window or windows for the fleet vehicle.b. A distribution representing likely failure modalities for the fleet vehicle, assuming no maintenance.c. A distribution representing likely revenues predicted for the fleet vehicle over a particular time period (e.g., the next month or 30 days).These distributions are continually or periodically updated for each fleet vehicle in the fleet management system.When a particular fleet vehicle self-reports1110an actual or predicted problem or issue, the fleet management system implements the following process:a. The system initiates a self-service ticket for thevehicle1112.b. The system locks down further reservations for thevehicle1114.c. The system reviews the likely failure modalities probability distribution for other failures for the self-reportingvehicle1120.d. The system reviews the likely failure modalities probability distribution for other fleet vehicles1122that are geographically adjacent to the self-reporting vehicle (where being “geographically adjacent” can be determined based on a distance, radius, or defined geographic area) for both (i) the problem or issue that was self-reported, and (ii) other failures for the geographically adjacent vehicles.e. The system them attempts to build one or moreoptimal maintenance manifestos1124across multiple fleet vehicles in an area (which may be a part of, equal to, or greater than the “geographically adjacent” area) that solves for the following factors:(1) Total cost of the maintenance manifesto (across multiple fleet vehicles in the area).(2) Total expected downtime (across the multiple fleet vehicles).(3) Minimization of any cancelled reservations (or reservations to be cancelled).f. The system compares the total cost of maintenance with the cost of taking no action while keeping the vehicle closed toreservations1130.g. If the system selects the option of taking no action while keeping the vehicle closed to reservations, the system periodically repeats1132(e.g., every X hours) the above calculations with updated probability distributions. If the self-reporting vehicle is still offline (i.e., closed to reservations) after a particular time period, the system escalates the problem or issue to a fleet manager.h. If the system selects the option of taking maintenance action, the system selects the optimal maintenance manifesto, and initiates dispatching of the vehicle(s) to known distributedmaintenance providers1140.Vehicle Allocation and TransferIn several embodiments, the present invention provides for pro-active fleet planning and management of existing vehicles. Various predictive programs are used to determine vehicle use patterns and trends over various time periods, and the system may direct the movement of various fleet vehicles from one location to another location based on these predictions. Fleet movement may be accomplished by bulk transport means (e.g., multiple vehicles loaded on a truck), or by strategic pricing for users seeking to pick up a vehicle at a first location and drop it off at a second location. In the latter case, the system may provide strategic pricing for particular vehicles that the system determines should be moved to the second location.Fleet vehicles also may be transferred from fleet to fleet, or between components of a fleet. A TCU or similar unit as described above enables the rapid and easy transfer of a vehicle between fleets or components. Examples of systems and methods for sharing vehicles between fleets are disclosed in U.S. Pub. No. 2015/0294403 (published Oct. 15, 2015 by Zipcar, Inc.), which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.Fleet vehicles also may be removed from a fleet, and returned to a lessor or manufacturer, or sold to a third party. In these circumstances, the system conducts an analysis of the vehicle condition, and compares to pre-established sales standard (for a third-party sale or auction), or a pre-established lessor or OEM return standard. Necessary servicing, maintenance or repairs may be conducted in a similar manner as described above for servicing, maintenance or repairs during normal operations.Connected User Interaction, Applications and InterfacesMore detailed information about interactions between connected users and a connected fleet management system as described herein (including user applications and interfaces), and examples thereof, are disclosed in the co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/986,504, filed May 22, 2018, and Ser. No. 15/986,528, filed May 22, 2018, which are incorporated herein in their entireties by specific reference for all purposes.In order to provide a context for the various computer-implemented aspects of the invention, the following discussion provides a brief, general description of a suitable computing environment in which the various aspects of the present invention may be implemented.

       "  'description': \"FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to vehicle event recorders. More specifically, the present invention is related to distributed vehicle event recorder systems that include networked portions coupled via the internet.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONVideo surveillance systems are used to provide video records of events in locations of special interest. For example, retail banking offices are generally protected with video surveillance systems that provide video evidence in case of a robbery. While video surveillance systems are generally used in fixed location scenarios, mobile video surveillance systems are also commonly used today.Video systems also have been configured for use in conjunction with a moving vehicle, for example, for use with police automobiles. As a police cruiser is frequently near the scene of an active crime, important image information may be captured by video cameras installed on the police cruiser. However, activity of interest occurring in the proximity of an automobile may not always be related to criminal activity. One example is a traffic accident, for which events and circumstances leading up to an automobile collision may be preserved so that an accurate reconstruction can be created and a more precise assessment of cause, fault and liability may be determined.Accordingly, the use of video systems in automobiles is rapidly becoming an important tool that is useful not only for the protection of specific individuals, but also of the general public. Some examples of automobile video systems in the prior art are illustrated below.U.S. Pat. No. 5,570,127 to Schmidt discloses a video recording system for a school bus that has two video cameras, one for an inside bus view and the other one for a traffic view, and also has a single recorder and a system through which the two cameras are multiplexed at appropriate times to the recording device. A switching signal controls which camera is in communication with the video recorder, so to view passengers on the school bus at certain times and passing traffic at other times.U.S. Pat. No. 5,586,130 to Doyle discloses an invention for an apparatus and a method for detecting fault conditions in a vehicle data recording device, so to detect tampering or unauthorized access. The system includes vehicle sensors for monitoring one or more operational parameters of the vehicle. The fault detection technique contemplates storing a current time value at regular intervals during periods in which the recording device is provided with a source of main power. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,071 to Doyle discloses a method and apparatus for monitoring parameters of vehicle electronic control units.U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,093 to Kikinis discloses a computerized vehicle log, based on a vehicle accident recording system that employs a digital camera connected to a controller in nonvolatile memory, and on an accident sensing interrupter. The oldest memory is overwritten by the newest images until an accident is detected, at which time the memory is blocked from further overwrites to protect the more important images, which may include important information about the accident. Kikinis teaches that the system may include a communication port, by which stored images are downloaded after an accident to a digital device capable of displaying images. In particular, images may be downloaded with a wired download to a server having specialized image handling and processing software thereon.U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,326 to Turner teaches an antitheft device for an automotive vehicle having both an audible alarm and a visual monitor system. Video monitor operators are responsible for monitoring and handling an emergency situation and informing an emergency station.U.S. Pat. No. 6,088,635 to Cox et. al discloses an accident video recorder for a railroad vehicle, which provides for a recording of the status of the railroad vehicle prior to an accident. A monitoring unit continuously monitors the status of the emergency brake and horn of the railroad vehicle. Video images are recorded and captured for a predetermined period of time after detecting that the emergency brake or horn blast has been applied as an event trigger.U.S. Pat. No. 6,185,490 to Ferguson discloses a vehicle crash data recorder that is arranged with a three stage memory to record and retain information. The recorder is equipped with series or parallel hardwire connectors to provide instant on-scene access to accident data.U.S. Pat. No. 6,246,933 to Bague teaches a system and a method for recording traffic accident data and for reproducing a traffic accident. A plurality of sensors register parameters of vehicle operation and include at least one vehicle-mounted digital video and audio camera for sensing, storing, and updating operational parameters. Re-writable, nonvolatile memory is provided by the microprocessor controller for storing the processed operational parameters, video images and audio signals. Data is converted to a computer readable form and read by a computer, so that an accident can be reconstructed via the collected data.U.S. Pat. No. 6,298,290 to Abe et al teaches a memory apparatus for vehicle information data. A plurality of sensors, including a CCD camera, a vehicle speed sensor, a steering angle sensor, a brake pressure sensor, and an acceleration sensor are all coupled to a control unit, which transfers information to a flash memory and a RAM memory. The collected information collected is transmitted through a video output terminal. This video systems is data intensive, and a wired system is necessary to provide sufficient bandwidth for transferring large amounts of data.U.S. Pat. No. 6,333,759 to Mazzilli teaches a 360° automobile video camera system. A complex mechanical mount provides for a single camera to adjust its viewing angle, generating a 360° range for video recording inside and outside of an automotive vehicle.U.S. Pat. No. 6,389,339 to Just teaches a vehicle operation monitoring system and method. Operation of a vehicle is monitored with an onboard video camera linked with a radio transceiver. A monitoring service includes a cellular telecommunications network to view a video data received from the transceiver to a home-base computer. These systems are aimed at parental monitoring of adolescent driving. The mobile modem is designed for transmitting live video information into the network as the vehicle travels.U.S. Pat. No. 6,411,874 to Morgan et al. discloses an advanced law enforcement response technology. A central control system provides the control for numerous subsystems associated with a police car or other emergency vehicle, driving a plurality of detector systems that include video and audio systems distributed about the vehicle.U.S. Pat. No. 6,421,080 to Lambert teaches a digital surveillance system with pre-event recording, which is relevant in accident recording systems because detection of the accident generally happens only after the accident has occurred. A first memory is used for temporary storage, and images are stored in the temporary storage continuously until a trigger is activated that indicates an accident has occurred, causing images to be transferred to a permanent memory.U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,389,340, 6,405,112, 6,449,540, and 6,718,239 to Rayner disclose cameras for automobiles that capture video images, both with forward-looking and driver views, and that store recorded images locally on a mass storage system. At the end of a day of service of the vehicle service, an operator inserts a wired connector into a device port and downloads information into a desktop computer system having specialized application software, so that the images and other information can be played-back and analyzed at a highly integrated user display interface. However, an administrative operator is not able to manipulate or otherwise handle the data captured in the vehicle at an off-site location without human intervention. Instead, a download operator must transfer data captured from the recorder unit device to a disconnected computer system. While proprietary ‘DriveCam’ files can be e-mailed or transferred through the Internet, the files are in a format that can only be opened by specific DriveCam software running at a remote computer. Therefore, a major disadvantage is that a human operator must service the equipment daily in a manual download action.Therefore, vehicle event recording systems in the prior art are not structured to have system components located remotely from one another. At best, a manager workstation computer must be positioned in the vehicle parking facility, forcing that manager and all the users of the server to make use of the server at the parking facility. As a consequence, personnel requiring access to the recorded information must go to the server facility to receive that information, and even if data were transmitted by e-mail in proprietary digital formats, such data may not be in readable formats at the receiving ends, and time would be consumed to access those receiving computers.Therefore, the systems in the prior art cannot be structured as distributed systems, limiting deployment due to the above described drawbacks.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the present invention to provide a fleet management system based upon a vehicle event recording system.It also is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle event recorder system that includes a distributed network component.It is another object of the present invention to provide a vehicle event recorder system that includes the internet.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fleet management system, in which automated reporting is enabled, so that a fleet manager can take specific actions in response to reports automatically generated by the system.It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a fleet management system, in which a data analyst may be far removed from fleet vehicles.It is still another object of the present invention to provide distributed fleet management services and applications, in which an insurance underwriter can process data captured by the system to manage risk.It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a fleet management system, in which an automobile maintenance team can respond to conditions detected and reported by the system.It also is an object of the present invention to provide fleet management system, in which a roadway or highway engineer can receive reports and alerts which relate to roadway conditions.It is one more object of the present invention to provide fleet management system, in which government authorities can act upon data captured by the system.These and other objects of the present invention are accomplished by apparatus and methods related in a distributed vehicle event recording system that are deployed in networks which may include the Internet. The vehicle event recorder system of the present invention finds applications in vehicle fleets and relates to video recording systems, communications networks, centralized server computers, and specialized application specific computer code to enable highly unique system functionality.Fleet vehicles communicate with the server, and data exchange is automatically triggered in response to normal and common use of the vehicle without intervention by the driver or fleet manager. Vehicles returning to an appropriately arranged parking facility automatically connect to the server to download video data to the server, where it may be processed and further accessed by various interested parties. Such video data includes primarily scenes before a vehicle that are captured when the vehicle is involved in an event such as a traffic accident.Vehicle fleet management networks are characterized as including at least one vehicle event recorder, a communication space formed from the combination of a vehicle parking facility and a wireless communications system, a network that may include the Internet, and an application specific server computer.A vehicle event recorder includes a radio transmitter and is further coupled to the communication space by way of a proximity trigger, so that the presence of the vehicle in the communication space enables data transfer actions, by which video data is conveyed from the vehicle to a remote server for further use. The vehicle event recorder includes a camera, a microprocessor, a memory, a mobile wireless transceiver, a connection manager, and a proximity trigger. Video images captured by the camera are stored in a specially arranged memory buffer until the vehicle returns to a parking facility, where images are automatically transferred to a remote'server.A communication space includes a parking facility, a fixed wireless transceiver, a network address server, a broadband connection to a communications network, and authentication systems. Upon arrival of an authorized fleet vehicle into the communication space, an enabled connection between the vehicle event recorder and the fixed wireless transceiver includes an authorization process. A vehicle suitably identified can then call a remote server via a proprietary data exchange method. Accordingly, servers include application specific software, a connection to a computer network, and web applications and web services arranged to cooperate with vehicle event recorders.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe above and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:FIG. 1illustrates schematically various types of fleet vehicles in respective groups, each in communication with a central server via the internet;FIG. 2illustrates in greater detail a facility in which fleet vehicles are in communication through the internet;FIG. 3illustrates an embodiment that includes a ‘store and forward’ preprocessing station;FIG. 4is a block diagram of a vehicle event recorder unit suitable for use in an automobile;FIG. 5is a block diagram illustrating elements of a vehicle event recorder unit;FIG. 6is a schematic representation of cooperative systems forming a network relationship with recorder elements;FIG. 7illustrates examples of a system server and illustrates functionality associated therewith;FIG. 8is a diagrammatic representation of a relationships between entities that interface with a server via networks;FIG. 9shows a relationship paths between network entities, vehicle event recorders and related servers;FIG. 10illustrates a system having a plurality of download spaces related to a single server;FIG. 11illustrates fields associated with a scheme to enlarge a download space; andFIG. 12illustrates a proximity trigger which sets into motion a function of the systems of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThroughout this disclosure, reference is made to some terms which may or may not be exactly defined in popular dictionaries as they are defined here. To provide a more precise disclosure, the following terms are presented with a view to clarity so that the true breadth and scope may be more readily appreciated.Vehicle Event Recorder: An electronic apparatus that may include video recording equipment, audio recording equipment, vehicle system sensors, environmental sensors, a microprocessor, application-specific programming, and a communication port, among others. A vehicle event recording unit is sometimes built into a small housing suitable for mounting to a common vehicle such as a truck, car, motorcycle, airplane, or ship. Some vehicle system sensors may not be contained within the housing of the vehicle event recording unit and may include electronic. Wireless, or wireline communication, for example a ‘bluetooth’ link.Wireless Communication Space: A region in which a electromagnetic communication signals may be reliably received and transmitted by at least two communicating transceivers. The wireless communication space has a ‘soft’ boundary that is not defined to be some particular size at all times. However, a wireless communication space still is a discrete entity.Fleet: A group of related vehicles. The relationship between vehicles in any one fleet is generally by ownership or management; however, other factors may connect the vehicles of a single fleet. For example, maintenance interests may cause several vehicles owned by independent parties to become part of a ‘single fleet’ for the purpose of the present systems. A ‘fleet’ may also be comprised of a single vehicle. While outside the traditional sense of the word fleet, a single vehicle fleet is fully included for the purposes of the systems discussed herein.Proximity Trigger: A system devised to detect a prescribed proximity condition and provide an electronic signal in response thereto, the electronic signal being coupled to another system which may be set into action as a result of receiving the proximity trigger signal.Event Trigger: A system devised to detect a predetermined physical condition and provide an electronic signal in response thereto, the electronic signal being coupled to another system that may be set into action by receiving the event trigger signal.Parking Facility and Parking Lot: Any place that can accommodate temporary storage of a vehicle for at least a short period of time. It is not necessary that the vehicle actually stops nor fully engages a ‘parked’ status. A slow moving vehicle in a certain space, such as a specially configured ‘download’ lane, may be designated for the purposes of this invention as a ‘parking facility’. Therefore, a parking facility/lot merely indicates a place that a vehicle might occupy while within range of a radio transceiver.Download Space: An area over which a wireless communications link can be maintained between the radio transceiver of a vehicle event recorder and a fixed wireless transceiver. “Download Space” is also meant to include a facility, in which a vehicle can be temporarily accommodated (parked) while a communication link is maintained.A vehicle event recorder system constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention relates to at least one fleet of vehicles and includes a recorder unit that may be connected to a download space, a wireless radio having a broadband network connection, and a server computer system arranged to provide application specific functionality. Application specific functionality is provided as web services and web applications, which may be supplied from a remote server via TCP/IP transactions over a public communication network. In this event, proprietary protocols are adopted, in which microprocessors in vehicle recorder units make calls to and receive responses from remote servers.Due to its highly mobile nature, a vehicle is not easily connected in a permanent manner to an information networks. While limited connection support may be envisioned, for example, via USB or fire-wire hardwire connection, or via a mobile telephone network, these connections have burdensome limitations which render such arrangements undesirable. Temporary hardwire connections require a human operator and significant daily overhead associated with a download strategy. Mobile telephone networks have bandwidth limitations and reliability issues which prevent the use of these connections in the manner required by certain high performance applications.In a system according to the present invention, a vehicle enters a communication space having wireless coverage that enables the vehicle to be connected to the server and communicate therewith. The relationship between the vehicle event recorder and the communication space is such that mere entry of the vehicle establishes the communications link and initiates at least a download transaction. Accordingly, an operator need not carry a laptop to each vehicle and initiate a physical connection.Referring toFIG. 1, the communication of an independent fleet of vehicles with a centralized server by way of a highly distributed network such as the public internet is described. Communication space1is the region of space covered by wireless communications radio service. For example, when a communications link comprises a ‘WiFi’type radio transceiver2, reliable communication may be sustained only over a limited range, which may be approximated by a sphere having a radius of a few hundred feet. Therefore, a common parking facility such as a small parking garage may be served by a WiFi radio system, which is large enough to cover fleets of a few dozens of vehicles all parked in a common parking location. Accordingly, these systems include cooperation between a storage location for vehicles and a wireless data communications link; that is, the range of transceivers is configured to envelope and surround the appropriate vehicle storage location.Thus, the extent of wireless communication space1is defined by and served bywireless radio transmitter2, which broadcasts radio signals into the space. When a specially configured mobile computer installed within aprescribed fleet vehicle3enters the communication space, the computer detects this condition. Upon detection that a signal is present (that a vehicle has arrived in the communication space), the computer makes a communication connection and performs a ‘handshaking’ which includes a network address assignment, for example, from a radio or router service arranged as a network address server. Once the mobile computer has a network address, it is ready to communicate directly over the internet4and with network nodes similarly connected. The radio is preferably connected to the internet by broadband connection5, for example a digital subscriber line DSL or cable or fiber type connection or a mix of these high-speed systems. Finally, as a network endpoint, application specific system server6is comprised of programs suitable for communicating with a plurality of vehicle event recorder units and a plurality of communication spaces, which may be widely and remotely distributed.Various vehicles3, including trucks, motorcycles, buses, etcetera, together form an example of a fleet. A fleet is generally a group of cars which are somehow interrelated. A fleet may be comprised of a plurality of vehicles such as the school buses of a single school district. Fifty buses may form a fleet of vehicles with a common owner, administrative staff, physical management facility and parking lot. Accordingly, a school bus vehicle fleet is ideally suited for an embodiment of this invention.Any particular fleet may have associated therewith a parking lot or other storage area, to which fleet members are returned each night after a day of service. In one embodiment, such parking space is equipped with a radio transceiver or radio transceiver network, so that all vehicles connect to communicate with the internet upon their arrival at the parking facility. Thus, a vehicle storage location is combined with a suitably arranged transceiver, which envelopes the vehicle storage location incommunication space7. Radio transceivers form a communication envelope, which surrounds a parking facility, whereby returning vehicles pierce the envelope boundary as they enter the parking facility and a reliable communications connection to the internet is automatically initiated after the vehicle enters the communication space. Application specific computer programming code running on the vehicle event recorder enables the vehicle event recorder to contact a remote server and perform transactions therewith. Thus, a driver need not manually set, trigger, connect or enable any actions. In fact, the driver need not even be aware of the existence of the system and of its operation. A driver merely has to return the car to the parking lot to cause a communications connection to be enabled automatically.While the embodiment described in detail herein is on that includes fleet members of the type characterized as ‘motor vehicles’, i.e. cars, motorcycles, trucks and buses operated on streets and highways, this embodiment is not limited to those kinds of vehicles, but can also serve vehicle systems which are not automobile-type vehicles.For example, downloadspace8can be arranged, in which yachts enter that space to cause an automated communications connection. A harbor can support a fixed WiFi transmitter and high-speed internet connection, through which all boats entering the harbor are enabled with communication to a server. Under this arrangement, a harbor is a ‘parking facility’.Similarly, airplanes that approach an appropriately equipped gate come into contact with the system server that can download information recorded during the service of that aircraft aircraft. A restrictive meaning should not be associated with the term ‘vehicle’ to conclude that only cars are being considered herein.As described, vehicles equipped with event recording units automatically establish a wireless communications link with a remote application server that is configured to communicate with the vehicle event recorders upon entering predetermined communication spaces. There is no longer a need for a human operator to engage a vehicle to establish a physical connection by way of a mechanical plug-in device and system, to remove and exchange tapes from tape recording type systems, and to manually perform a download step, or an on-site fleet IT manager to be involved in any way.Independent fleets of vehicles, which are maintained, owned and operated by independent parties, may similarly be in communication with the same server. Aseparate communication space7which may be remotely located with respect to anothercommunication space8, serves an entirely different and unrelated fleet. For example, when public authorities operate and maintain a fleet of emergency vehicles9, these vehicles may entercommunication space7to activate a communications link, whereby data recorded by recording unit can be downloaded to the centralized server. This communication space may be a parking lot associated with city vehicles. It may also be the same parking lot that is appropriate for storage of vehicles overnight. This way, the vehicle operator returns the car to the lot at night for storage, and without taking any further act causes data to be downloaded to the remotely located server. Thus, the lot only need be equipped with a WiFi transmitter connected to the internet, and it is no longer necessary to maintain a computer on-site. Such architecture frees fleet information technology managers from the need to be in the same location as the fleet vehicles. It is no longer necessary to maintain a strong IT capacity at the same location where the vehicles are stored. A ‘smart’ parking lot only needs to be equipped with very inexpensive WiFi radio transmitters and a broadband connection to the nearest Internet service provider.Referring now toFIG. 2, an architecture including additional system elements in communication with a vehicle event recorder network is shown in greater detail. In particular,server21having a defined and fixed network address associated therewith is in communication withmass storage database22, and is further coupled by way of the internet to awireless radio transceiver23. The transceiver has a useful range which defines the extent of communication or downloadspace24.One skilled in the art will appreciate the advantages of having the internet situated between the architecture endpoints, i.e. the server or database network node and the vehicle recorder unit network node. As fleet vehicle storage and information technology professionals and offices are sometimes not in the same location, efficient communication over long distances has to be provided. Moreover, because the data collected for this system is useful to different independent and distributed parties, is similarly useful to access to the data over highly distributed networks that include the Internet.While the internet is a public system, it also can be used for highly secure and private transmissions of information. For example, link26, dedicated to the application at hand, may permit the server to communicate privately with known system members. In some instances, this can be achieved by way of a virtual private network orVPN27. It is also possible to simply arrange communications over the public network, in a coded fashion only understood by the server and the vehicle event recording units aboardvehicles28,29and210. Each of these vehicles, being qualified members of the system, exchange digital transactions with a prescribed server. An unauthorized computer attempting to communicate with the server could not properly form requests without prior knowledge of the services and communication protocols available on the server. Thus, the server's private services would not be easily accessible to non-members.The server connected to the internet is widely available to all systems similarly coupled to the internet, without regard to location. Thus, web applications may be served to authorized users by the same server alongcommunication path211. As the server is connected to the internet in this manner, any number of users may establishcommunication212simultaneously with the server. Individual managers operatingremote workstations213can view web applications provided by the server and interact therewith from any location in the world. Thus, an administrator of recorded vehicle video information needs no longer to be present at the vehicle or at the vehicle's parking facility, which had previously been near in distance or co-located with the location where the vehicle fleet is stored during the night.A parking facility may include an IT office with a download workstation running desktop applications. The entireremote intranet214of a company of a number of employees may be similarly connected and in communication with a server and database, holding data captured by a vehicle event recorder. Because the data gathered by a vehicle event recorder is useful for employees that are not a top level fleet administrator or manager, other parties interested to vehicle use and management no longer have to receive raw data by unmanaged e-mail transmission, or visit a physical site where a vehicle is parked, nor rely on human operators to download data from the necessary vehicles each day when the vehicle arrives at its storage facility. When vehicle event recorders are coupled through automatic downloads to high power servers connected in a shared network relationships, information is processed more efficiently and results in a system of greater functionality and processing power.Another important strategy permits system members, for example computer programs in recorder units, to consume ‘web services,’ computer services or programming functionality. The programming functionality is not available to outside systems, nor there are any visible components or a human interface to the web services, which are provided for computers to interact with computers. Thus, a vehicle event recorder unit in a vehicle, which is in a predetermined communication space, may call a computer function which resides and is executed on the remote server. Thus, very large processing power and database capacity is available at the same time at a relatively small computing facility associated with a vehicle event recorder unit, obviating the need for a computer workstation at the parking site.Another advantage to having the internet as part of system architecture relates to customer interaction from various locations. Interested parties may not be located in a common place with download and server facility, partly because many unrelated parties may have an interest in the same data. For example, insurance underwriters may be interested in reviewing driving histories, and it would be overly burdensome for insurance underwriters to review driving records at a fleet facility.Because of the nature of vehicle fleets and of the activity associated therewith, it is sometimes necessary to provide a different system architecture. In particular, special circumstances may arises in the situation where a large number of fleet vehicles returns to a lot at approximately at the same time. If a server computer is separated from the vehicle fleet by a link of limited bandwidth, excessive data traffic will prevent properly organized downloads from all vehicles. As it is physically impossible to provide links of unlimited bandwidths, a local buffer may be deployed, which is arranged to receive and hold a massive amount of video data from all returning cars and to later transfer that information over time to a server is an improved arrangement.The problem is exacerbated when fleet ‘turn-around time’ is short, for example, in a taxi or police fleet, where the vehicles are used on multiple shifts with various drivers. In this situation, it is impossible for the server to download data from one vehicle at a time in a serial operation, because the vehicles in the download queue will tend to return to service before their download operation may be completed.An alternative system architecture configuration is described inFIG. 3, and includes a dedicated workstation computer co-located at or near the facility where vehicles are stored. The dedicated workstation computer includes specialized data management services and provides fast download, store and forward functions, scheduling, and authorization administration, among others. In some instances, it is preferable to include a very high speed downloading service on site at the parking facility. This is particularly the case when several vehicles arrive simultaneously, for example at a shift change. Since not all broadband connections to the internet are sufficient for quick transfers of very large quantities of data, in some cases a workstation computer configured should be configured for authorization and authentication processes, to receive at very high speeds information including video data from arriving vehicles, for buffer storage of that data, for data queue management, and for further transferring data to a centralized server at a later time.Accordingly,FIG. 3showsserver31properly coupled tomass storage database32. By properly coupled, it is meant that provision is made for fast, frequent, and efficient exchange of data. To this end, not only is bandwidth very high, but the programming between code running on the server and code running in the database are tuned with respect to the application at hand and formed in conjunction with one another. The server is connected via the internet to workstation ‘store and forward’buffer computer33, which is co-located at the parking facility where fleets vehicles are stored. The workstation computer is in communication with the WiFi wireless transmitter via very high speed communications link34that provides communication space35, into which arrivingvehicles36may be received. Such download may be completed in a very short period of time. Data is passed wirelessly from a vehicle event recording unit to the WiFi transmitter, and thereafter to the workstation computer. Data is temporarily stored at the workstation computer, and is later transmitted through theinternet37, then over modest bandwidthprivate link38, and finally arrives atserver31anddatabase32. This server provides web services and web applications towide audience39, which may utilize these services and application anywhere where internet access is available. In this manner, data collected by fleet vehicles is made available to widely distributed interested parties.The premise of these embodiments lies in fleet vehicle management strategy. As such, one system endpoint is a vehicle event recorder which is suitably affixed and mounted within a common vehicle especially an automobile. These devices may be a permanently affixed within vehicles and will soon be provided as standard equipment. Electrical couplings such as power supply and data connections with the vehicles electronic systems may be made through standard connectors and interfaces. These devices are thus coupled to the vehicle and its systems. They are further coupled to the vehicle whereby an optic axis of a camera is aligned to provide images of events occurring about the vehicle. In some versions a second camera has a field-of-view includes the space which contains the vehicle operator. A single vehicle event recorder may be provided with a plurality of cameras and corresponding number of image spaces. Thus some vehicle recorder units contain two cameras, one pointing forward and one pointing toward the operator spaces.These devices are sometimes arranged to be completely self-contained and require as little mechanical connection with vehicle systems as possible. For example, it is necessary to have a good mount, which provides that the optical axis be aligned with desired fields of view; however, it is not a requirement that the device be integrated with a vehicle computer or other vehicle hardware.The head portion of a vehicle event recorder system is shown in greater detail inFIG. 4, which illustrates vehicle event recorder head41in block diagram form. The primary elements includemicroprocessor42including application specific computer code,electronic video camera43, event triggers44,memory buffer system45,connection manager46, andradio communication system47. In some versions, an on-board data bus, OBD,diagnostics system48is included. Such OBD systems are coupled to sensors atvehicle subsystems49such as lights, engine, brakes, and steering, among others, to provide feedback as to the state of those systems, which may yield further information in conjunction with video data related to causes of events being recorded.Vehicle event recorder systems are built about a microprocessor suitable for use in computing platforms for self-contained electronic apparatus. In most cases, these microprocessors are not arranged as general computing platforms, but rather with application specific firmware directed to particular functions at hand. These processors support the ability to perform application-specific functions and drive complementary subsystems such as memory, input/output ports, network connections, video input, and event triggers, among others.Particularly worthy of mention among these functions is ‘event handling’, wherein an event trigger causes execution of a computer routine and an image or image series collected by a camera is transferred from a temporary short-term buffer memory to a durable and lasting memory, where it may be stored for a considerable period of time. Thus, the microprocessor is responsive to an event trigger such as an accelerometer and a predetermined threshold, which detects abrupt movements and sets the microprocessor into action to transfer stored data from one memory to another.Further, the microprocessors of vehicle event recorders are arranged to support wireless connections and data exchange with authorized networks. In particular, the microprocessor is coupled to a proximity trigger which is toggled whenever the vehicle event recorder enters a prescribed communication space. Upon detection of such proximity condition, the microprocessor attempts an authorization step whereby the identity of the network and vehicle event recorder are checked and verified.If the vehicle event recorder is identified as one properly located within an authorized download space, the microprocessor continues with a data transfer or download step, in which information stored in the memory of the vehicle event recorder is transferred wirelessly to either a server or to a ‘store-and-forward’ workstation for later transmission into the broader systems network.After a completed download, error checking and confirmation steps permit the microprocessor to complete the connection to proceed with a disconnect operation.The functions including connection detection (sometimes called ‘proximity detection’), network address client, authorization, download, disconnect, among others, are sometimes arranged as part of a connection manager module.An electronic video camera may be arranged such that it has a field-of-view which includes an environment about a vehicle. For example, the forward space ahead of a car is an area generally of great importance in consideration of accidents which occur from time-to-time. The camera is further coupled to the microprocessor and image buffer, so that images captured by the camera may be discarded when it is determined that those images are no longer of importance, or in the opposing case, saved to a durable memory when it is determined the images are associated with an important event.This type of video cameras is arranged to continuously capture video images both before and after an accident, should one occur. Thus the cameras are durable and fixed mechanically in a vehicle, so that they can survive the impact associated with a collision. While in most cases it is anticipated the camera will be affixed within the driving compartment, an alternative includes mounting cameras on the exterior the vehicle, for example, at a rooftop or coupled with a bumper. The camera is in electronic communication with the microprocessor, whereby the microprocessor operates to drive camera functions.Event triggers include means for sensing an important event and in response thereto activating the microprocessor to perform save operations, preserving images associated with the detected important event. Event triggers may be arranged about various systems including an on-board data bus, accelerometers, a panic button, or a time interval trigger. An onboard data bus may be arranged as an event trigger when some measured parameter exceeds a prescribed threshold to indicate the occurrence of some condition. When the threshold is exceeded, an electronic signal can be provided to the microprocessor queuing it to handle images accordingly. Alternatively, accelerometers can detect very strong movements such as a car swerving or breaking excessively hard, or a direct collision. In these situations, the events may be declared important and the accelerometer will provide the signal upon which the microprocessor will act to preserve images recently captured and those captured soon after the event.A ‘panic button’ type event trigger may be arranged as a tactile switch, which a user can engage when the user makes a judgment that an event has occurred. When a driver sees some relevant activity, she can engage the panic button to cause an image save operation. An event trigger may be as simple as a mere timed interval. After a certain period of time has elapsed, an image save operation can be executed. In this case, the mere passage of time causes a signal, which sets the microprocessor into action to save images.Vehicle event recorders in these embodiments include important memory systems. Preferred memory systems include those having a managed loop buffer, where images are temporarily stored for brief periods of time. When an event occurs, trigger toggle images are transferred to a second more durable memory from the managed loop buffer, thus preserving images associated with the event. In some versions, the managed loop buffer is embodied as a semiconductor memory such as a DRAM memory, which is quite fast and may be written to many millions of times without exhausting its functionality. In the same system, the durable memory may be fashioned from a flash memory system suitable for holding large amounts of data, including video type data. Said flash memories are very inexpensive and have suitable capacity for holding video information associated with a large plurality of separate events, which may occur throughout the service day of a vehicle event recorder.Wireless communications radios in wide use today include those known as WiFi transceivers. A WiFi transceiver is very inexpensive radio, which generally includes network functions such as network address handling services, router services, firewall services, and network switching, among others. Thus, it is an advantage of these systems to deploy WiFi type transceivers, so that a vehicle entering a parking facility can be automatically connected to a cooperating network.New, soon to be introduced, systems boast far greater range than those WiFi systems; for example, “WiMax” systems will have range of a few, perhaps tens of miles. It is useful in some embodiments to arrange WiMax transceivers in conjunction with a parking facility in a vehicle event recorder system. In either case, a wireless communications transceiver has a finite and limited range, which gives rise to a coverage region or communication space and some implicit peripheral boundary. While we use herein WiFi and WiMax systems as examples, it will be recognized by a person skilled in the art that many alternative wireless systems are available, some which might be used in place of a WiFi or WiMax system. WiFi and WiMax have been described here because of their adequate performance characteristics and very low-cost.In addition to these subsystems, the vehicle on-board data bus system or OBD is also coupled to the vehicle event recorder microprocessor. An on-board data bus is an electronic system coupled to a plurality of transducers and sensors throughout the vehicle, each of which collects data related to vehicle characteristics and performance. The on-board data bus may include information about drive train and transmission, engine operational status, brakes, lights, et cetera. The on-board data bus is useful in vehicle event recorders for providing additional data and information, which relate to the status of a vehicle, subsystems and engine conditions at a particular time of interest, for example in association with a traffic accident.Subsystems of vehicle data recorders may include additional optional elements. Some of the most important of these optional elements are illustrated in the block diagram ofFIG. 5alongside with the primary elements. Data recorder unit51comprises computer microprocessor52with appropriate vehicle event recording management programming installed. Two cameras53include a forward-looking camera and microphone54and a driver compartment camera and microphone. Advanced highperformance memory system55includes a two-stage buffer of managedloop memory56, and flash memory57is provided according to attributes and the nature of these systems and applications. Radio58provides a wireless communications link in conjunction with connection manager59, which couples the microprocessor to systems external to the vehicle event recorder head. Internal web server module510runs within the device to provide an hypertext transfer protocol interface, whereby internal adjustments to subsystems may be effected via remote web browsers. Some embodiments include position determining means511such as a global position system GPS locator. Other sensors and transducers512may be deployed about a vehicle to measure parameters related to vehicle performance, independent of those transducers that are already a part of the on-board data bus system. In addition, data collected from an on-board data bus directly coupled to the microprocessor provides similar functionality.Graphical user interface514provides a visual means of conveying messages and information to a human operator. User tactile input means515such as a keypad may also drive activity within the vehicle data recorder head. Event triggers518, including accelerometers516and panic button517, are arranged to indicate to the microprocessor the occurrence of an instant event and the need to preserve images associated therewith. Finally, internal illumination system519is provided for nighttime use.In some versions, a forward-looking camera and exterior microphone are arranged to record video and audio information outside the vehicle compartment. Conversely, a vehicle event recorder system may additionally deploy a second camera as a vehicle driver compartment video camera and second microphone as an interior microphone, arranged to record video and audio inside the driver compartment. Thus, it is said here that vehicle event recorders include at least one camera, but may also include any number of auxiliary cameras and microphones.In some embodiments, a vehicle event recorder may be provided with a very large capacity memory system such as a disk drive unit. A so-called ‘microdrive’ can be arranged as a very small memory system capable of recording video data over extended periods. All driving activity throughout a service day, including service days with no accidents, may be of interest in some system versions. Thus in the present embodiments, a recorder is started in the morning at the beginning of the service day and operates to continuously deliver data to the memory until the end of the service day, when the vehicles are returned to the storage facility. All recorded data including non-accident or non-event related data is put into memory and downloaded at the end of the day. This way, the vehicle event recorders of these embodiments completely omit accident triggers that manipulate data storage systems, so to prevent overwrite of memory.In other embodiments, a computer module known as a ‘web server’ may be included, so that a vehicle event recorder that has established a communications connection may be addressed and manipulated by way of a common computer internet browser. Thus, a vehicle event recorder present in a communication space may be ‘browsed’ by remotely located systems operators. It is possible in this manner to reset or to otherwise manipulate various adjustable settings which may be within the vehicle event recorder. It is not necessary to physically access the vehicle event recorder with a screwdriver for example, in order to change the brightness or contrast of the video system. Instead, an operator located in India may adjust the brightness of a particular vehicle after noticing problems in a video analysis operation being taken up far from the vehicle location. While updated firmware downloads can provide the same function, a web browser provides a highly functional user interface front end which is easily operated by anyone who can operate a computer.A recorder unit may be equipped with GPS receiving system511. At all times, a GPS receiving system can provide a position signal to the microprocessor for recording. Position determination results can be recorded by these versions of vehicle event recorders to associate measured location with accident video. Further, the system sometimes includes an electronic compass device, which can measure the direction of a reference axis associated with the vehicle. Thus, one can tell precisely in which direction the vehicle is pointing at various recording intervals and this information can be similarly recorded.It is also possible to incorporate other transducers, which are coupled to the vehicle in some way to measure physical parameters of the vehicle or its environment. These transducers might be coupled to the processor directly and connected to one or another vehicle subsystem. For example, a drive shaft pickup might include a magnet which the detects every turn of the drive shaft. This information could yield indications as to vehicle speed, which are important during accident review.Some versions of these vehicle event recorders include a graphical user interface in the form of a display unit, suitable for converting electronic signals provided by the microprocessor to graphical messages easy to read and understand by human users. After properly logging in, a driver may receive a message reminder to “drive safely” on such displaysA tactile keypad is provided in some versions in order to allow users to provide inputs to the Microprocessors. Where fleet vehicles are shared by several drivers, it is useful to provide means for a driver to identify herself to a system by way of a touchpad code or PIN number. As such, vehicle event recorders may sometimes be provided with such keypad input devices suitable for these functions.For nighttime use, or in other no or low light level conditions such as when the vehicle enters a tunnel, these vehicle event recorder units may include integrated IR illumination system519, providing illumination in the driver compartment that does not distract the driver. Infrared light is detected by the video camera but cannot be seen by the driver. Accordingly, the infrared light does not distract the driver.In some circumstances, wireless mobile phone networks may also be used for the communication link in special versions of these systems. In this regard, the wireless communication space boundaries are defined by the extent of the cellular network coverage. Since mobile phone network systems are relatively mature, the coverage area attainable is considerable. Accordingly, vehicle event recording systems arranged in this fashion may have a wireless communication space of considerable extent, covering tens or even hundreds of square miles.Video frames selected from a series may also be transmitted. For example, while recording locally at a rate which far exceeds one frame per second, one could transmit at less than that rate over the limited bandwidth wireless telephone network. Thus, the system could convey image information albeit in limited quantity, resolution or rate.In systems deploying a mobile telephone network as a communication link, the ‘proximity trigger’ described above becomes somewhat ambiguous, because the vehicle rarely leaves and reenters communication space and may remain continuously therein during the entire service day. In the embodiments described above, a vehicle's entry of the download space is the trigger which causes a download action. However, such triggers are ineffective when mobile telephone networks are used as the communications linkConsidering now the opposing node of these networked vehicle event recorder systems, reference is made to the portion of these network systems that includes the server and data consumer clients. In particular, reference is made toserver computer61, which communicates by way of the internet with a plurality of prescribed and authorized member entities. While data is received from vehicle event recorders along paths62from remote recorder units as previously explained, it is relevant to how such collected data is distributed, analyzed and consumed.Recorded information which bears indication and history as to the use and abuse of vehicles is important to a number of interested parties. For example, a fleet administrator/manager keeps track of vehicles and drivers he manages not only for maintenance and safety purposes, but also with respect to scheduling and loss prevention, among others.A fleet administrator/manager working fromworkstation64located in any part of the world can interact with web applications served by the server to manipulate and examine data recorded by any of the fleet vehicles. Web servers can be arranged to provide a fleet manager access to vehicles under her specific management only and to restrict access to the information collected by vehicles under the management of an independent entity. Thus a single server can be used by completely independent entities who manage different fleet vehicles. No other system known in the arts has a single server which can receive information from various vehicles belonging to different fleets, sort that information accordingly, and restrict its access to the appropriate authorized parties. Thus, in a municipality, a vehicle maintenance department can subscribe to the service by way of the internet in parallel with the fleet manager of a private fleet operation. While the two users know nothing of the other, they share a common server, database and service provider, thereby reducing costs for all.The server/service provider might include high security level administrative workstation65, which has a direct private connection and unique credentials to the server. A service administrator, requiring high-level administrative privileges to the server, may be connected on the inside of a strong firewall. Such administrative node is not appropriately exposed over the Internet for security reasons.Applications consumers66-69, include network nodes which communicate with the server by way of its applications and services. Special applications may be configured for different particular users or data consumers. Some of these special purpose applications are illustrated hereinafter.Insurance adjusters and underwriters use advanced data analysis to better position themselves with regard to risk management. Presently, reports and statistical analyses available to insurance adjustors and underwriters are largely compiled by manual processes. When insurance adjusters and underwriters deploy and use the systems described herein, immediate access is provided from their remote offices to detailed current data from vehicles insured by their companies. This data set can be accessed directly from the server having an application host running a special insurance application configured to serve the precise information that insurance underwriters and adjusters need. Some information relating to vehicle use remains private with respect to the vehicle's owner and driver, however, by agreement with insurance companies, a vehicle owner may decide to make available and submit particular information in consideration for preferred insurance rates. In this situation, the server of these systems provides an application, addressable by insurance underwriters, to deliver information that insurance companies can use to manage risk.In addition, insurance underwriters will find another advantage in using of the system of the present invention. The mere presence of a vehicle event recorder system has a very strong effect on drivers wishing to keep their jobs. Mere knowledge that a detailed video record will be available to fleet managers in case of incident keeps driver behavior in check. Thus, even placebo systems arranged to appear functional but in fact totally inoperable will provide insurance underwriters with a great advantage. However, where a fully operable system is deployed, insurance underwriters will be in far better position to manage risk more precisely.Insurance company workstation computer66connected to the internet can communicate with the server computer and employ the web services and applications that are provided specifically for insurance companies. Thus, the server is arranged with particular web applications that insurance companies can use to monitor the vehicles insured by them. In this manner, insurance companies can mitigate their exposure to high risk vehicles and situations. An insurance company can maintain a constant monitoring for changes that might affect their position and can remain highly responsive thereto. Such high access to current information is be a powerful tool for insurance underwriters to develop advanced risk management strategies. Previously, insurance companies had only access to vehicle history records by way of a public authority and clients reporting and history.These systems of the present invention enable another important management application yielding advantages not only to fleet vehicles, but also to the roadways upon which the vehicles operate. Data collected by these systems includes information about traffic accidents, therefore, computing systems can be set up, whereby a threshold can be triggered to indicate a dangerous condition. For example, if several accidents happen within a short period of time at the same location, this occurrence may be indicative of faulty roadway equipment such as a malfunctioning traffic light. When a threshold is exceeded, the systems of the present invention can be arranged to send an e-mail notice to roadway engineers, notifying them of the dangerous condition.Workstations67used by road safety engineers having access to e-mail and the internet may also be connected to the systems of the present invention. Thus, road safety engineers might look to web applications served by the embodiments described herein to provide information related to some particular road safety issue.For example, if there are fifteen automobile crashes at Fifth and Elm street during the month of July, the server can trigger a message and send it to a road safety engineer. Some condition may have changed at the intersection unbeknownst to the authorities. The message could put the road engineer on alert that something has happened and the intersection has become dangerous. For example, a huge pothole maybe causing cars to swerve just at the moment when drivers need to pay attention to incoming traffic at the intersection.Another example of how road service engineers might use the systems of the present invention includes the following. To determine the safe speed on a road, some municipalities set a threshold indicator. For example, it may be determined that 85% of drivers drive at or below the “safe speed”. In this regard, a system keeping track of vehicle locations and of the speed at which the vehicles are driven may be used to compile information for any particular road stretch and determine what is the safe speed per that section of the road. Road safety engineers can use this information to provide proper signage and road construction elements, such as guard rails, indicators, warnings, etcetera. Some versions can be completely automated and left unattended by human operators. The computer can monitor roadway conditions without input from anyone, and provide appropriate notice when a certain condition is met. Such highly automated systems can prove extremely valuable for general public safety.Another important application enabled by these systems relates to Departments of Motor Vehicles managed by local authorities, that typically maintain records of traffic accidents and driver behavior.Since the systems disclosed herein provide highly effective data capture functions, and further provide ready and easy access to such data, a Department of Motor Vehicles may employ these data capture and management systems via a server applications host running a program configured and designed to provide particular types of data. With vehicle event recorder systems arranged as described here, it is now possible for a driver to be involved in a collision at 10 o'clock in the morning, and a video record can be made available at the Department of Motor Vehicles by 10:02 (or before). When a vehicle event recorder is coupled to remote servers as described, and where such remote servers provide need-specific web applications to interested parties, very valuable data handling processes are enabled.Other workstations68, similarly having access to the internet, can be used by other users that require information sorted and arranged for their specific application. These users may include entities like vehicle leasing companies. It may be a condition of the lease that the vehicles are used in a safe and proper manner, and a leasing company with access to information provided by these servers through the related web applications can easily check the status of the vehicles it owns.Very relevant are also applications that relate to vehicle fleet management and administration. Scheduling functions, tracking systems, maintenance operations, etcetera can be organized and provided via computer programs, whereby a human fleet administrator/manager can read and manipulate data with the functionality made possible by systems of the present invention. Thus, a large fleet of vehicles operated in southern California may be maintained and organized by a fleet manager in New York City. With systems according to the present invention, it is no longer the case that the fleet manager has to be situated in the same location as the vehicles, because the systems of the present invention include a highly efficient capture and sorting of information that is provided automatically and directly from fleet vehicles to a remote server, which may be accessed by fleet administrator/managers anywhere.Maintenance workers might use a particular web application that compiles information relating to wear and tear on the vehicle. Oil changes, tire rotation, wheel alignment, and other general maintenance actions should be performed in view of conditions which can be managed and detected by the server. It is a common practice that oil should be changed every 3000 miles. However, this rule of thumb does not reflect very accurately the conditions upon which oil should really be changed. Oil suffers degradation from many factors, and particularly from excessive heat and high ‘rpm’. So the system could set some oil change guidance based on detailed use of the vehicle rather than a simple mileage scheme. If the car runs with high revolutions on many hot days, the oil may need to be changed before 3000 miles. Conversely, if the car is gently driven with low engine stress on mildly cool days, it may not be necessary to change the oil until 4500 miles. Oil changes is a very simplistic example, but is provided here to show that web applications can be used for more accurate guidance in the maintenance of vehicles. Data collected throughout the vehicle service day, recorded and stored, later transmitted to the server, and properly sorted and analyzed by a web application can be read by a maintenance engineer to keep a vehicle in good condition. While fleet management is an application of the embodiment described herein, other interested parties may have a similarly important stake in the fleet vehicle data management systems of the present invention.Another very important application relates to teenage use of vehicles. Systems are provided for use by families that have new drivers, generally teenagers learning to drive. Teenagers account for a disproportionately large percentage of vehicle accidents, including vehicle accidents that result in deaths. However, when young new drivers know that they are being observed, that their actions will be recorded, and they will be held accountable, better decisions may be made with regard to driving. Thus, parents might be premium subscribers to a service that will benefit them by protecting their children. Special applications can be prepared and delivered by an application host, whereby parents can inquire as to the use of vehicles by their teenagers. Accordingly, families can benefit from reviewing detailed vehicle use information including video data that is easily accessible from the privacy of one's own home by way of an internet server arranged in accordance with these embodiments.FIG. 7shows a block diagram which corresponds to the concept of independent web applications and services provided at a server.Communication space71is associated with parking facility72, such as a common parking lot that is enveloped by a space in which a reliable communications connection can be made viawireless radio73. Further,broadband connection74to the internet couples thecommunication space71to the system server, whereby video data collected at various vehicle event recorders may be transferred to the server.A server computer is arranged to provide computer services including, but not limited to, a general computational service, a database service, an e-mail service, and a web application service, among others. For the purpose of the present embodiments, a primary function of the server lies within an applications host that may be arranged as a web server, under which a plurality ofindependent applications75, or interdependent applications, are executed and served toclients76via TCP/IP or other suitable protocol77. By way of example, the applications host of the server can be deployed as a Microsoft Internet Information Services IIS system. In conjunction with IIS, the Microsoft .Net technologies including the .NET framework and ASP.NET are suitable for providing the web applications and web services described herein.In a first example, aspecial application78is provided to perform download operations. When a vehicle enters a communication space and toggles a proximity trigger, a service module within the vehicle event recorder makes appropriate calls to the server, and more specifically the applications host, and also to the download application. The download application responds to these calls by executing operations that permit the vehicle event recorder to transfer data to the server for further processing. Thus, one application of an applications host includes a module to communicate and execute transfers with various vehicle event recorders. Other applications, which belong to the same application host, may operate independently of the download module. Further, these other applications may be designed to be addressed by application clients that are not vehicle event recorders, but rather other entities or interested parties.Thus, the system server includes computer code programming modules in the form of various web applications, each having access to data downloaded from vehicle event recorders. Web applications consumers or web “applications clients” connect to and communicate with these web applications by way of Internet protocol or TCP/IP, by way of example. These web applications, each perhaps independent of any other, provide information exchange function with these application clients.These systems include application-specific software suitable for fashioning network communications as ‘web request’ actions and for transmitting those web requests to the server whose network address is known a priori to vehicle event recorder systems. Web requests directed to a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator, or ‘internet address’) may be transmitted from the microprocessor of a vehicle event recording unit. These web requests include web requests directed to specific services, which may be provided at a system server and may include software upgrades, registry updates, scheduling information, as well as data download operations. Thus, a vehicle event recorder that has collected data through its service day is in a condition to download that data once it enters a suitable download or communication space and receives its network address assignment to enable communications with the prescribed servers. Servers are ‘known’ to vehicle event recorder units because their computers are programmed with a predetermined server network address or means of obtaining it dynamically. Further, a vehicle recorder unit computer is programmed to form appropriately designed web requests, so that the recorder unit can properly interact with the web applications and services provided by the server via the application host.In preferred versions, the vehicle event recorder unit includes special programming, which anticipates available web services. Such programming is suitable for making action requests to the server and is operable for processing returned responses that are in a particular format. Thus, the vehicle event recorder unit is specifically programmed with prior knowledge of services available at the server. Accordingly, vehicle event recorders cooperate together with established proprietary servers.Some web services provided by servers are not generic and cannot be processed by other computer clients that have no prior knowledge of the available services and of the proprietary interfaces or formats with which responses are returned. Thus, the server is a specially configured to communicate with the vehicle event recorders. The server is also configured to run self containedlocal applications79, which may be directed to data analysis and statistical services that operate on collected data without interaction of outside parties.Another module of the server includes ane-mail server710system, which can be arranged to respond to special conditions and events occurring inrelated applications711, whereby e-mail messages can be sent on the internet.FIG. 8provides another illustration related to applications ofserver81and to an applications host in accordance with vehicle event recorder systems of the embodiments described herein.Communication space82, which supports wireless downloads from vehicles having captured video data, is coupled to a remotely located server by way ofcommunication path83that may include the internet. The communication space is directly coupled to aweb application84arranged specifically for communication with vehicle event recorders, whereby it is operable for downloading collected data. The application may be called by vehicle event recorders through a specific network address or URL. Other application clients, such as those described above, may be fashioned as ‘read-only’ clients85, whereby the server provides data for analysis and use by interested parties, but those clients do not provide data to the server. These clients each communicate with the application host, by way ofvarious paths86, which may include unique URLs to appropriately direct communication traffic to the various particular applications87. An entirely different type of application/service, herein known as a ‘push’type service88, conversely is arranged to provide information to the server. Information from a push service is transmitted by way of the Internet, via explicit URLs or other routing protocol toparticular applications89arranged to receive information.Push services may provide information to applications that process this type of information and respond thereto by amending are augmenting certain records maintained by the entire system. For example, information from weather reporting agencies may be transmitted to these applications. The applications then sort and process the weather information, taking important pertinent parts, for example, weather conditions in certain areas at a certain time may be associated with a particular accident recorded by a vehicle event recorder.Other push services may include those that contain information from vehicle manufacturers, including include updates related to particular model vehicles which may be part of a vehicle fleet. In response to receiving such information, managers can alter the way they use and deploy these vehicles. Vehicle recall information may be transmitted that enables a fleet manager to respond by applying an appropriate fix as part of an automated maintenance program.FIG. 9describes push services of two different types that are arranged with various network connections. System server91, including specially designed applications92in communication with various interestedparty applications clients93, also includes specially arrangedapplication94, which receives information from push service95. In addition to this arrangement,other applications96are configured to communicate withpush services97, whereby information may be received over the internet while at the sametime push services97can provide information directly to vehicle event recorders over communication path98.These systems anticipate not only push services that are in communication directly with the server applications host, but also, at the same time, push services that are in communication directly with vehicle event recorder head units, without first passing through any applications at the server.A principle of the vehicle event recorder systems described herein includes the arrangement where a single server provides management and service to a plurality of independent fleets.Independent fleets of vehicles managed by separate entities may share a single server having a common applications host. While fleet members log-on with separate identities, the separate fleets may log-on to the same application host which is provided with powerful membership management facility to maintain separation between various fleets and associated data received from members of the fleet.A first fleet is associated withcommunication space100served bywireless radio101to communicate withfleet members102and103. Avehicle event recorder104deployed within the fleet member includesconnection manager105.Connection manager105includes computer programming code to properly identify and authenticate the vehicle as a member of a particular fleet when in communication withcentralized server106. A separate fleet may includetruck vehicle107as a member, in aseparate communication space108which is physically removed fromcommunication space100. Shouldvehicle109from the first fleet enter the communication space associated with another fleet, the condition may be designated as a non-authorized condition. In this event, communications and downloads would be prevented. Thus vehicle event recorders of these embodiments include connections managers appropriately suited to manage membership operations and distinguish between vehicles of particular fleets and communication spaces designated for authorized download operations.FIG. 11illustrates communication spaces and the networks which may exist within a single communication space. Since the size of vehicle fleets in use may exceed hundreds of vehicles, it may be necessary to arrange a communication space which is quite extensive. In these situations, it is impossible to serve a communication space that could accommodate the entire fleet of hundreds of vehicles with a single radio transmitter of the WiFi type, because these transmitters have limited ranges not compatible with the parking facilities required to accommodate large fleets. Accordingly, it is a single parking facility of a large area can be served by a plurality of WiFi transmitters networked together.FIG. 11showsremote server111, includingdatabase112,application host113, and at least oneweb application114coupled to the internet and further toextended communication space115.Communication space115is comprised of a plurality ofindividual communication spaces116spatially removed but overlapping one another to operate in conjunction with each other to service an extended andlarge parking facility117.FIG. 12illustrates the proximity trigger. By entering the communication space and piercing the envelope of the radio transceiver range boundary, the vehicle causes the proximity trigger to be toggled.Server121is inbroadband communication122withradio transceiver123servingcommunication space124. Moving vehicle125transits from outside of the communication space to the interior of same communication space to causeproximity trigger126to be activated. Upon detection of the proximity trigger being toggled,vehicle event recorder127equipped withconnection manager128responds by providing handshaking and authentication with the radio transceiver and further performs a download function, in which data is passed to the remote server in direct response to the vehicle entering the download space.Thus, the actions of vehicles trigger and cause network responses without intervention of human operators. The arrangement of these systems provides an automated means of passing video data collected in vehicle event recorders to remotely located servers for further processing.While some wireless communications systems, such as WiFi and WiMax systems, have a large bandwidth, wireless telephone networks do not. Since vehicle event recording systems tend to capture data in extremely large amounts, wireless telephone networks are sometime not suitable for this application. However, systems can be arranged whereby only a select or ‘abbreviated’ dataset is passed over the wireless telephone network.It is easy to appreciate that some types of data are well-suited for transmission over low bandwidth communication links that can cover a large area. On the contrary, transmission of high-resolution, live video is may be difficult. On the other hand, where a system is devised such that an abbreviated set of video images is occasionally transmitted, the wireless telephone network may operate reasonably well as a communications link in these systems.In a first illustrative example, an event recorder duly writes data to a local storage in accordance with the operation described herein. This set of data, extremely large in quantity, is suitable for local storage but not for transmission over the bandwidth of limited wireless telephone type networks. Data written to the local storage could be subject to a download action when the vehicle returns for high-bandwidth communications link. However, while connected via a wireless telephone communications network, the system can be arranged to transmit bandwidth limited subsets of data including selected video frames.Non-video data recorded by the system may be suitable for continuous transmission. Non-video data can be very small in size and easily transmitted over low bandwidth communications links. For example, a numeric, position-only measurement data may result in a dataset that is quite small and easily transmitted via a mobile phone network. Thus, a vehicle event recorder system which captures a position measurement can be arranged to transmit that type of information over the bandwidth-limited communications link into the system network.An abbreviated video sequence may include a video sequence that can be detected by some preset mechanism. For example, an ‘impact detector’ might trigger a transmission of a limited amount of video data, for example three seconds of video prior to the impact and up to three seconds after the impact. This limited dataset might not be transmitted in real-time, but it can be transmitted within a reasonable time and passed to the server while a vehicle is still in the field.Systems arranged to download data as described, i.e. in limited datasets, may be deployed with mobile telephone networks as a communication link. In such cases, an alternative trigger system may be employed.In the situation where fleet vehicles never rest or ‘park’, a download station may operate as one in which a vehicle merely enters, performs a download and then leaves without a full parking, stopping, or storage action.While embodiments of the invention are described above, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made. The appended claims are intended to cover all such changes and modifications that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\",\n",

A “connected fleet” comprises a plurality of vehicles, some or all equipped with (i) on-board sensors and computer systems for monitoring and capturing the operational status and performance of vehicle systems and components, and (ii) one or more electronic control and/or communications units for two-way or multiple pathway communication with one or more fleet management servers or networks, outside data centers or sources, other vehicles, and individual user or driver computing devices. A “connected user” comprises a user with one or more computing devices, including, but not limited to, mobile computing devices such as smart phones, tablets, or wearable devices, that provide extended, continuous, uninterrupted electronic communications with various computer networks, devices, and systems, including, but not limited to, elements of the connected fleet computing system or network, regardless of where the user is and how they are connected. Connected users may include, but are not limited to, drivers, passengers, customers, renters, members of a vehicle sharing service, employees, owners, or operators.Vehicles in a connected fleet may include, but are not limited to, automobiles, trucks, vans, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, mopeds, construction and utility vehicles, battery-powered carts, golf carts, airplanes, aircraft, boats, watercraft, and the like. Vehicles may be controlled by a driver or user, or may be autonomous or semi-autonomous. A fleet may include, but is not limited to, a rental vehicle fleet, shared vehicle fleet, peer-to-peer or business-to-business transportation fleet, taxi-cab fleet, corporate vehicle fleet, municipal or governmental agency vehicle fleet, bus fleet, utility or construction vehicle fleet, truck fleet, or combinations thereof. A fleet may be homogenous or heterogeneous (i.e., a mixed fleet). Fleets may be combined to make larger fleets, and fleets may also be sub-divided into component fleets by various parameters (e.g., type of use, type of customer or user, country, state, city, county, or other defined geographical area). The term “fleet” as used herein includes fleets of all types and various combinations, components or sub-divisions thereof.In several embodiments, the present invention comprises a unique, single integrated platform for management, planning and control of a connected fleet of vehicles. The invention (or portions thereof) manages fleet planning, in-fleeting operations, vehicle acquisition and provisioning, vehicle assignment, vehicle transfers (i.e., to another fleet or another component fleet in the larger fleet), vehicle use operations (i.e., reservations, use and return by a customer, member, driver or user), vehicle servicing, vehicle maintenance and repairs, and de-fleeting operations (e.g., removal of the vehicle from the fleet, return to manufacturer, or sale to third parties).In several embodiments, the present invention uses a programmable TCU installed in a vehicle and connected, directly or indirectly, to the CAN bus or similar vehicle network. The TCU may be directly wired to the vehicle network or components, or may be plugged into or otherwise connected to a data port, such as the OBD II port. A TCU may be self-powered, or powered by vehicle energy sources by connection to the vehicle or OBD II port. The TCU receives data and information from existing vehicle sensors and computing systems. Sensors include internal and external sensors.In several embodiments, the TCU includes at least one processor and a chipset for providing cellular communication capability, thereby enabling the TCU to engage in two-way data communication via existing cellular telephone networks. Through this communication capability, the TCU may identify itself and the vehicle in which it is installed to the management system, and receive programming from the management system so that the TCU maybe utilized in the particular vehicle in which it is installed. Upon installation, the TCU will detect vehicle identification information and transmit that information to the management system. The management system, or a backend or subset system networked to the management system, can thereafter select the appropriate programming for the vehicle make and model identified by the TCU, and cause the management system to transmit firmware updates and programming to the TCU so that it may be properly configured for use in the installed vehicle.The TCU may further include dedicated short range communication capability, via a built in communication device, such as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)device100. This technology enables wireless local communication with the TCU. For example, if the dedicated short range communication technology includes Bluetooth capability, the TCU can enable keyless access to a vehicle, for example, via a Bluetooth-enabled mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. To utilize this technology, an authorized user can press a button, provide a code, or engage in other authentication schemes via a mobile device, thereby causing a wireless signal to be transmitted over a short distance and be received by the TCU dedicated short-range communication device. The TCU thereafter confirms whether the signal is valid and, if so, commands the vehicle to unlock the doors via the OBD II connection. Wireless short-range communication technology, standards, and formats that can be utilized for this type of communication include, for example, Bluetooth, BLE, ZigBee, RFID, NFC and WiFi Direct.Short range communication technology may also be utilized to monitor vehicle location at a facility or to detect when a vehicle is returned to or removed from a facility. In one implementation, the TCU may act as a transmitter (beacon), and receivers positioned around the lot receive the transmitted signal and notify the management system of the position of the vehicle using wired or wireless protocols and communication capabilities built into the facility. A receiver may also be located at the exit gate of the facility, to permit egress of authorized vehicles, and to inform the management system that the vehicle is exiting the lot. The system can also be configured such that the management system transmits contract data to a gate agent when a vehicle approaches the exit gate, such that the gate agent can check for proper identification. In an alternate implementation, the TCU can act as a receiver, which receives information from beacons positioned at a facility and transmits location data to the management system via the TCU cellular connection.Additional functionality can also be provided where the TCU includes short range communication capability. For example, a user with a Bluetooth enabled mobile device could activate vehicle components, such as flashing the lights or blowing the car horn in order to identify a vehicle in a lot. A user might also activate vehicle remote start technology remotely via a mobile device. A short-range RF enabled TCU, operating as a beacon, could be sensed by a user mobile device and displayed on the user's device in a map showing the location of the user with respect to the vehicle, thereby assisting the user in locating the vehicle. Similarly, a short-range RF enabled TCU would permit the TCU to be located and tracked as a piece of equipment in inventory, when the TCU is not installed in a vehicle. Dedicated short-range communication capability would also enable the TCU to receive vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and positive train control technology warnings and communications, which could be forwarded to vehicle occupants, or transmitted to the management system via the TCU.A TCU with short range communication capability would also enable peer-to-peer communication between TCUs in different vehicles. This is useful in managing a fleet of vehicles, as a TCU in one vehicle can communicate with the fleet management system via one or more TCUs installed in nearby vehicles. In this manner, two-way communication can be maintained between a vehicle and the fleet management system when the vehicle has no cellular communication capability due to malfunction or loss of signal. Through this chain of communication, the fleet management system can receive data from an out of communication vehicle and can transmit programming and instructions to that vehicle via a nearby TCU or series of TCUs.The present invention further comprises a vehicle access component, that also may both user-facing and internal fleet system elements. This may be part of the reservations system, or work in conjunction with a reservations system. The user seeks access in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, obtaining keys to the vehicle from a car rental agent, presenting an authorized user card to a card reader in the vehicle, or using a mobile computing device to communicate with a TCU or dedicated access unit in the vehicle.In cases where the user is attempting key-less access to a connected vehicle, such as by wireless communication with a user's mobile computing device, there are several methods to determine whether to allow access. In some cases, access may be permitted if the user is a pre-authorized registered user and presents a general access code or authorization to the vehicle. In other cases, reservation data (either for a single reservation or for reservations over a period of time, which can be a day or several days) has been previously electronically communicated to the vehicle (e.g., transmitted to a TCU in the vehicle) and stored therein, and access is permitted if a user attempting access matches corresponding reservation data (i.e., user identity, time period, and the like). Alternatively, after receiving an access request from a user, the vehicle (i.e., through TCU or similar unit) electronically communicates with the fleet management system to confirm whether or not to allow access.In cases where the vehicle cannot establish direct communication access, it may attempt to establish communication through other connected vehicles, through the user's mobile device, or other wireless access points.In some cases, such as an underground garage or parking area, the vehicle and user's computing device may be unable to establish outside communications links in any fashion. In several embodiments, the fleet management system of the present invention previously provides a protected, secure, single-use token to the user's computing device upon making a reservation (or close to the starting time of the reservation), which is then securely communicated to the vehicle. The vehicle processes the token and allows access if the information in the token is valid.In several exemplary embodiments, the present invention comprises a system of multiple low earth orbit microsatellites that in combination provide global coverage, allowing for immediate, real-time communications with fleet vehicles, whether through a TCU or otherwise. Antennae for satellite communications are designed and installed in each fleet vehicle, either as part of the TCU or as an addition to OEM or other equipment in the vehicle.Low earth orbit microsatellites circle the Earth in approximately 90 minutes at an altitude of less than about 200 miles. In one exemplary embodiment, the present system comprises a “constellation” of 12 to 18 microsatellites providing continuous coverage globally, at an altitude of approximately 1200 miles or less, and orbital period of between about 84 and about 127 minutes (seeFIG.18). Communications links are switched from one satellite to another as the satellites move into and out of range of a particular vehicle. This global system allows for the collection of telemetry and vehicle information and facilitate the transaction nature of fleet vehicle rental or sharing. Information may be transmitted in data packets, and may include, but is not limited to, location, odometer readings, fuel level, and other vehicle sensor data. A microsatellite system as described above also may be used in other multimodal mobility or “connected transportation” systems, such as asset tracking, container tracking, container ship or vehicle tracking, shuttle tracking, or individual (e.g., athlete, parolee, child, and the like) tracking.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG.1is an exemplary depiction of a telematics control unit (“TCU”) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.2is an exemplary depiction of a TCU installed in a vehicle in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.3is an exemplary depiction of a network environment including a vehicle, a TCU, and a fleet management system, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.4is a flow chart of an exemplary method of operation pertaining to a vehicle in rental mode in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.5is a flow chart of an exemplary method of operation pertaining to a vehicle in sharing mode in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.6is a flow chart of an exemplary method of installing a TCU.FIG.7is a flow chart of an exemplary method of re-installing a TCU.FIGS.8A and8Billustrate data transmission of an exemplary mode of operation.FIG.9is a flow chart depicting command-response communication in one mode of operation.FIG.10is a diagram of the geo-tile location determination system.FIGS.11-16show views of various user interface screens from a vehicle return mobile device application in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.17shows a view of the return and repair management portal process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.FIG.18shows a diagram of execution of a CAN script on a telematics control unit in a fleet vehicle.FIG.19shows a diagram of a process for off-line access to a fleet vehicle.FIG.20shows a view of a low earth orbit microsatellite.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTSIn various exemplary embodiments, the present invention comprises a system and related methods for management, planning and control of a connected fleet of vehicles. A “connected fleet” comprises a plurality of vehicles, some or all equipped with (i) on-board sensors and computer systems for monitoring and capturing the operational status and performance of vehicle systems and components, and (ii) one or more electronic control and/or communications units for two-way or multiple pathway communication with one or more fleet management servers or networks, outside data centers or sources, other vehicles, and individual user or driver computing devices. A “connected user” comprises a user with one or more computing devices, including, but not limited to, mobile computing devices such as smart phones, tablets, or wearable devices, that provide extended, continuous, uninterrupted electronic communications with various computer networks, devices, and systems, including, but not limited to, elements of the connected fleet computing system or network, regardless of where the user is and how they are connected. Connected users may include, but are not limited to, drivers, passengers, customers, renters, members of a vehicle sharing service, employees, owners, or operators.Vehicles in a connected fleet may include, but are not limited to, automobiles, trucks, vans, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, mopeds, construction and utility vehicles, battery-powered carts, golf carts, airplanes, aircraft, boats, watercraft, and the like. Vehicles may be controlled by a driver or user, or may be autonomous or semi-autonomous. A fleet may include, but is not limited to, a rental vehicle fleet, shared vehicle fleet, peer-to-peer or business-to-business transportation fleet, taxi-cab fleet, corporate vehicle fleet, municipal or governmental agency vehicle fleet, bus fleet, utility or construction vehicle fleet, truck fleet, or combinations thereof. A fleet may be homogenous or heterogeneous (i.e., a mixed fleet). Fleets may be combined to make larger fleets, and fleets may also be sub-divided into component fleets by various parameters (e.g., type of use, type of customer or user, country, state, city, county, or other defined geographical area). The term “fleet” as used herein includes fleets of all types and various combinations, components or sub-divisions thereof.As described in detail below, in several embodiments the present invention comprises a unique, single integrated platform for management, planning and control of a connected fleet of vehicles. The invention (or portions thereof) manages fleet planning, in-fleeting operations, vehicle acquisition and provisioning, vehicle assignment, vehicle transfers (i.e., to another fleet or another component fleet in the larger fleet), vehicle use operations (i.e., reservations, use and return by a customer, member, driver or user), vehicle servicing, vehicle maintenance and repairs, and de-fleeting operations (e.g., removal of the vehicle from the fleet, return to manufacturer, or sale to third parties).Vehicle Selection, Acquisition and ProvisioningA lead component of fleet management encompasses the planning of the mix of vehicles for a particular fleet or component of a fleet, as well as the process of acquiring a particular vehicle and then processing it for incorporation into the fleet (sometimes referred to as provisioning). These components are often referred to as “in-fleeting.”The selection of vehicles for a fleet requires consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to, acquisition cost, ease and cost of servicing, maintenance and repairs (i.e., minimize vehicle holding costs), whether the vehicle is appropriate for the intended use, whether the vehicle is appropriate for the intended market, whether the vehicle is compatible with the particular technology used by the fleet management system, whether the mix of vehicles includes a variety of vehicles to allow appropriate user choice and optimize the user experience, and whether the mix of vehicles includes “aspirational” vehicles that align with the brand image of the fleet owner or operator and maintain vehicle experience standards and user expectations.Fleet vehicles can be acquired in a variety of ways, such as, but not limited to, purchasing and leasing. In some embodiments, some or all of the vehicles in a fleet may be owned by a person or entity other than the fleet operator or owner, including vehicles that may be intermittently or temporarily available for use in the fleet, such as in a peer-to-peer to business-to-business system. Thus, for example, an individual automobile owner may make their vehicle available for use in a car rental or sharing fleet when he or she is traveling or on vacation. In several embodiments, their vehicle may already be enrolled and provisioned in the fleet, and can be easily and quickly made available for use through a variety of means as described below.Provisioning takes place after acquisition of the vehicle. This includes the addition and installation of necessary equipment and materials, as necessary, for integration of the vehicle into the fleet and subsequent use. For example, an automobile being added to a car rental or sharing fleet may be equipped with an access card reader, a telematics control unit (TCU) or similar interface or control system, an electronic toll pass unit, one or more gasoline cards, and the like. The TCU is assigned to the particular vehicle in the fleet management system, typically in an administrative unit or as an administrative function. The vehicle may be assigned to a particular fleet group or component, and assigned to one or more locations (e.g., a home location, parking spot, or the like). If the vehicle is part of a commercial car rental or sharing fleet, it may also be assigned a particular class for pricing, availability to particular users, and the like.The extent to which a particular vehicle needs particular equipment added, such as a TCU, depends upon the characteristics of the vehicle (e.g., make, model and year). Many vehicles are manufactured with a variety of integrated sensors and computer systems for monitoring the operational status and performance of vehicle systems and components, although the configuration of sensors and computer systems varies by type, model and year of manufacture. For example, modern automobiles typically comprise a plurality of vehicle sensors and systems connected, directly or indirectly, to a controller area network (“CAN bus”), with data and information available through devices plugged into a data port, such as the On Board Diagnostics II port (“OBD II”).In several embodiments, the present invention uses a programmable TCU installed in a vehicle and connected, directly or indirectly, to the CAN bus or similar vehicle network. The TCU may be directly wired to the vehicle network or components, or may be plugged into or otherwise connected to a data port, such as the OBD II port. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,635,518 (issued Apr. 25, 2017 to Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC), which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes, connecting the TCU to the OBD II port has the advantage of enabling the TCU to be easily and quickly installed as an after-market device in the fleet vehicle, without requiring manual direct wiring or connection of the TCU to the vehicle network or various vehicle sensors and systems. A TCU may be self-powered, or powered by vehicle energy sources by connection to the vehicle or OBD II port. The TCU receives data and information from existing vehicle sensors and computing systems. Sensors include internal and external sensors. These sensors and computer systems may be more complex for semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,616,896 (issued Apr. 11, 2017); U.S. Pat. No. 9,587,952 (issued Mar. 7, 2017); U.S. Pat. No. 9,517,755 (issued Dec. 13, 2016); U.S. Pat. No. 9,499,172 (issued Nov. 22, 2016); U.S. Pat. No. 9,469,307 (issued Oct. 18, 2016); U.S. Pat. No. 9,440,652 (issued Sep. 13, 2016); and 9,278,689 (issued Mar. 8, 2016); all of which are incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.Direct connection of the TCU to the OBD II port enables the TCU to communicate through the port with manufacturer-installed sensors, electronics, data sources, operating systems, and computing system. The TCU may thus engage in two-way communications with certain existing vehicle components. When installed in a vehicle, and programmed for operation in connection with the specific vehicle and OBD II port device to which it is connected, the TCU may execute specific actions within or through the vehicle, such as activating lights, horns, unlocking and locking door locks, and the like. The TCU also may be programmed to disable or deactivate certain vehicle systems and components, such as the vehicle ignition or starter. This capability is very useful where the vehicle may be used by different people in different vehicle programs, such as a rental program, a sharing program and corporate or municipal fleet program.In several embodiments, the TCU includes at least one processor and a chipset for providing cellular communication capability, thereby enabling the TCU to engage in two-way data communication via existing cellular telephone networks. Through this communication capability, the TCU may identify itself and the vehicle in which it is installed to the management system, and receive programming from the management system so that the TCU maybe utilized in the particular vehicle in which it is installed. Upon installation, the TCU will detect vehicle identification information and transmit that information to the management system. The management system, or a backend or subset system networked to the management system, can thereafter select the appropriate programming for the vehicle make and model identified by the TCU, and cause the management system to transmit firmware updates and programming to the TCU so that it may be properly configured for use in the installed vehicle.As shown inFIG.1, the TCU includes at least oneprocessor10for executing program instructions. Theprocessor10can be coupled to removable/non-removable, volatile/non-volatile system memory20andcomputer data storage60, for permanent or temporary storage of programming, and system and sensor data. The memory can store computer code, computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data. For example, and not meant to be limiting,data storage60can be a hard disk, a solid state drive, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, magnetic cassettes or other magnetic storage devices, flash memory cards, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, random access memories (RAM), read only memories (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the like. Multiple processors, and multiple core processors, can also be provided.The TCU includes input/output (“I/O”)channels30for communication with the vehicle via the OBD II port via a connection at35. These communication channels may be one-way or two-way, enabling communication via the OBD II device with vehicle sensors, processing systems and buses. These channels provide discrete signals that control the actuations of features like door lock/unlock, activation of the horn, and enabling or disabling the vehicle starter. These channels may also be used for control of actuations not present on the OBD II port of the car, via direct or wireless connections.The TCU also includes amodem40and an associatedantenna45enabling two-way cellular communication with the fleet management system. Themodem40can comprise one or more communications components or modules, which can provide cellular or mobile data communication capability. Themodem40can operate on any frequency available in the country of operation. Although 3G, 4G, 5G capability (or better) is preferred, the type of communication can include, but is not limited to, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, 1×RTT or EV-DO, WiMAX, HSPAT, LTE and LTE Advanced standards. As an alternative, the TCU and modem could enable two-way satellite digital audio radio service via satellite communication networks.The TCU may be powered by the vehicle via the OBD II port connection. As an alternative, or in addition, the TCU may include a direct 12 v power connection to the vehicle power source. The TCU also may include a power supply (PS) with abattery50, to be independently self-powered or to provide back-up power. In the latter circumstance, the battery enables operation of the TCU, including cellular transmission of data, for a period of time in the event of a vehicle power loss or if the device is disconnected from the power source. The TCU is configured to sense the loss of power or data from the vehicle, and to determine whether that power or data loss is due to disconnection of the TCU from the OBD II port or a problem with the vehicle battery or power connection. For example, the cable between the TCU and the OBD II port can include a push-type switch on the connection plug, which would enable the TCU to detect whether the cable is plugged or unplugged. The TCU can also continuously monitor battery voltage, and can be programmed to report gradual voltage decay. The TCU can also check for power loss at the TCU power input pins to determine whether the TCU is receiving power. Accordingly, if power loss occurs, the TCU will notify the management system that it is utilizing power from thebattery50. If the TCU reports that the OBD II cable is disconnected, the management system can thereafter determine if the disconnection of the TCU was authorized, for example, where the vehicle is scheduled for servicing, or if the disconnection is not authorized. If the cable remains connected, and no voltage decay has been detected, the system can determine whether the power loss is within the TCU or within the vehicle by checking for power at the TCU input pins.The TCU may also include one or more indicator lights55, visible outside the device, to provide an indication of connection status and power. It may also include a buzzer or similar type of alarm, which can be programmed to activate when the TCU is installed, or in the event of loss of data or power connectivity. Different colors and patterns of lights can be utilized to indicate various issues with the device, and provide indications to an installer regarding success or failure of the installation. In several embodiments, the TCU may comprise an LCD or similar display screen for display of messages, alerts, or other text.While the TCU may be primarily designed to receive data and information from existing vehicle sensors via the OBD II port or otherwise, the TCU may itself includeadditional sensors65and other technology to provide additional information to the fleet management system. The TCU may include aGPS unit70, which includes a receiver that receives position information from a constellation of satellites, as is known in the GPS art. Additional technology can be incorporated into the GPS receiver to improve the accuracy of the equipment when the vehicle is located within metropolitan urban areas and in tunnels. For example, cellular triangulation, WiFi triangulation, and Bluetooth triangulation can be utilized. Data from the GPS unit can be read by the TCU and reported to the fleet management system on a continuous or periodic basis, or upon the occurrence of a specific event.The TCU may also include anaccelerometer80, such as a three-axis accelerometer, to detect and report vehicle impacts and driving habits. This sensor capability enables the TCU to set programmable thresholds, and detect and report when the accelerometer readings exceed those thresholds. The thresholds can be set to detect and report vehicle impacts, aggressive braking or acceleration, or improper handling of the TCU. Such data may be used by the management system to monitor, evaluate or rate driver behavior, to detect accidents, or to trigger maintenance on the vehicle. The accelerometer data may also be combined with incline measurements to detect vehicle towing or tampering. Such sensors may be programmed as always-on sensors in order to detect impacts, towing, and the like, even when the vehicle is not in use. Sensors installed in the TCU may also include their own processor capability. Additional sensors that could be incorporated into the TCU include, but are not limited to, light sensors, pressure sensors, heat sensors, occupancy sensors, motion sensors, and vibration sensors.Additional sensors and devices may also be installed in a vehicle and directly connected to the TCU to provide additional system functionality. For example, the TCU may be connected to acard reader90installed on or in the vehicle to enable vehicle access by persons using an access card. The card reader may be installed on the windshield or in the dashboard to permit access to a vehicle without a key. The card reader can connect to the TCU via the I/O channels30, via a dedicated interface such as a serial interface or a Wiegand interface, or through a wireless interface such as Bluetooth. Other devices that authenticate a user and permit access or activation of a vehicle may also be installed, including, but not limited to, a fingerprint reader, a touch-pad sensor or keyboard, a retina scan device, a breathalyzer (or other sobriety testing devices), and the like. Additional sensors and devices that can be installed in the vehicle on an after-market basis for communication with the TCU include, but are not limited to, an occupancy sensor, a smoke detector, and sensors to detect hazardous or illegal substances. If the vehicle includes a key storage compartment or lock-box, a sensor to detect the presence of the key, or a device to control access to the compartment, may also be installed and placed in communication with the TCU.The TCU may further include dedicated short range communication capability, via a built in communication device, such as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)device100. This technology enables wireless local communication with the TCU. For example, if the dedicated short range communication technology includes Bluetooth capability, the TCU can enable keyless access to a vehicle, for example, via a Bluetooth-enabled mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. To utilize this technology, an authorized user can press a button, provide a code, or engage in other authentication schemes via a mobile device, thereby causing a wireless signal to be transmitted over a short distance and be received by the TCU dedicated short-range communication device. The TCU thereafter confirms whether the signal is valid and, if so, commands the vehicle to unlock the doors via the OBD II connection. Wireless short-range communication technology, standards, and formats that can be utilized for this type of communication include, for example, Bluetooth, BLE, ZigBee, RFID, NFC and WiFi Direct.Short range communication technology may also be utilized to monitor vehicle location at a facility or to detect when a vehicle is returned to or removed from a facility. In one implementation, the TCU may act as a transmitter (beacon), and receivers positioned around the lot receive the transmitted signal and notify the management system of the position of the vehicle using wired or wireless protocols and communication capabilities built into the facility. A receiver may also be located at the exit gate of the facility, to permit egress of authorized vehicles, and to inform the management system that the vehicle is exiting the lot. The system can also be configured such that the management system transmits contract data to a gate agent when a vehicle approaches the exit gate, such that the gate agent can check for proper identification. In an alternate implementation, the TCU can act as a receiver, which receives information from beacons positioned at a facility and transmits location data to the management system via the TCU cellular connection.Additional functionality can also be provided where the TCU includes short range communication capability. For example, a user with a Bluetooth enabled mobile device could activate vehicle components, such as flashing the lights or blowing the car horn in order to identify a vehicle in a lot. A user might also activate vehicle remote start technology remotely via a mobile device. A short-range RF enabled TCU, operating as a beacon, could be sensed by a user mobile device and displayed on the user's device in a map showing the location of the user with respect to the vehicle, thereby assisting the user in locating the vehicle. Similarly, a short-range RF enabled TCU would permit the TCU to be located and tracked as a piece of equipment in inventory, when the TCU is not installed in a vehicle. Dedicated short-range communication capability would also enable the TCU to receive vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and positive train control technology warnings and communications, which could be forwarded to vehicle occupants, or transmitted to the management system via the TCU.A TCU with short range communication capability would also enable peer-to-peer communication between TCUs in different vehicles (i.e., vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V). Communications also may include vehicle-to-infrastructure. This is useful in managing a fleet of vehicles, as a TCU in one vehicle can communicate with the fleet management system via one or more TCUs installed in nearby vehicles. In this manner, two-way communication can be maintained between a vehicle and the fleet management system when the vehicle has no cellular communication capability due to malfunction or loss of signal. Through this chain of communication, the fleet management system can receive data from an out of communication vehicle and can transmit programming and instructions to that vehicle via a nearby TCU or series of TCUs.As shown inFIG.1, the TCU also includes adata port110. The data port enables access to the OBD II data for vehicle maintenance and diagnostic purposes, without the need to disconnect the TCU. Thedata port110may emulate an OBD II data port, so that an OBD II device can be plugged into the TCU data port.For ease of installation and programming, all of the components of the TCU are preferably housed together in a single, rigid, tamper-resistant case designed to be securely installed inside a vehicle, typically underneath the dashboard of the vehicle, with a cable connection or direction connection to the vehicle OBD II port. However, certain components of the TCU could be housed elsewhere without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the TCU could rely upon an accelerometer or a GPS unit located outside the TCU, including, for example, systems installed by the vehicle manufacturer. However, such configurations increase programming and installation complexity. Further, reliance on external systems and sensors make it more difficult to track the TCU and conditions associated with its transport, as these sensors could not provide data to the management system in the event the TCU is removed from the vehicle.In several embodiments, the TCU or similar components may be contained in a modified ignition key, as further described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,841,987 (issued Sep. 23, 2014 to Local Motion, Inc.), which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.The TCU typically includes a single processor. However, an alternative configuration may utilize two or more processors. Where two or more processors are present, each may be programmed to operate in a different vehicle mode. For example, one processor may be pre-programmed to operate in a vehicle rental mode, while a second processor is pre-programmed to operate in a vehicle sharing mode. In a dual processor configuration, a controller may be included to activate the appropriate processing system in accordance with the active mode set by the management system or through other means described herein.The apparatus illustrated inFIG.1is exemplary, and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of operating architecture. Neither should the apparatus be necessarily interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated therein.An exemplary depiction of a TCU installed in a vehicle is shown inFIG.2. The OBD II is connected tovehicle sensors125and vehicle networks, such as the controller area network or CANbus130. Additional vehicle sensors, microcontrollers, a host computer, andother systems135are also connected to the CAN bus. TheTCU140receives data and information from theOBD II port145through a wired connection. Since the OBD II port is connected to the CAN bus, the TCU will have access to CAN bus data, information, systems and sensors. The TCU may also be connected to external sensors and devices added to the vehicle, such as acard reader150. TheTCU140communicates viacellular data network160with afleet management system170.The TCU, interfacing with the vehicle via the OBD II port, can monitor various vehicle systems and sensors, determine vehicle conditions, and report data indicative of vehicle status and performance to the fleet management system, in accordance with TCU programming. This includes, for example, vehicle VIN, fuel level, odometer readings, vehicle battery level, door status, ignition status, tire pressure, headlight sense, window up/down status, seat adjustment status, radio station presets, operating temperatures, operating pressures, vehicle speed, engine fuel air mixtures, oil quality, wiper usage, break pad conditions, air-bag deployment, and other data from vehicle sensors and vehicle computer systems. The TCU can also receive and communicate data from in-vehicle communication devices and warning systems, such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication devices and systems and positive train control technology. The TCU can also monitor and report diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) and malfunction indicator lamps. The TCU also monitors and reports data derived from TCU components and sensors, including GPS data, accelerometer data, and IMEI and SIM card numbers. The TCU processor monitors all of this data and information, formats and stores the applicable data in the memory and/or data storage device, and transmits data to the management system, all in accordance with TCU programming. Transmission of data may be programmed to occur on a continuous, periodic or event-driven basis, or a combination thereof. Different transmission timing can also be set in accordance with a particular vehicle TCU operating mode. The TCU processor can also employ data compression protocols and methodologies, such as MQTT protocols, in order to limit the amount of memory required or to minimize data transmission and the costs associated therewith.FIG.3depicts an example of a network environment in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. As depicted therein,management system300includes a plurality of sub-systems including, for example,fleet management servers305, mobile andweb management servers310, and reservation andrental application servers315. Each subsystem may be connected to one or more databases and processors. The management system may also include a backend system where OBD II codes and protocols associated with different fleet vehicles may be managed and stored. The management system communicates viacellular networks320andcell towers325with TCUs installed infleet vehicles330. These communication systems enable two-way communication between themanagement system300and eachTCU335. TheTCU335includes various hardware components including, for example, a processor, memory and data storage capability, sensors, and GPS technology. TheTCU335also includes I/O channels for communication with sensors installed on the vehicle outside the TCU, and means to connect the TCU to factory installed vehicle sensors and systems, such a cable that connects the TCU to the vehicle OBD II port.TCU335also includes a modem and antenna, which enables communication between the TCU and cellular networks via cellular towers. Finally,TCU335may include short range communication technology which enables local communication withmobile devices340, such as a user's mobile phone. The short range communication capability may enable the TCU to communicate with sensors positioned around a facility, and with TCUs installed on nearby vehicles as described above. Using a mobile device, an authorized person may communicate with avehicle TCU330/335and remotely initiate certain vehicle actions. Separately, an authorized person may communicate with themanagement system300via amobile device340having cellular communication technology, viacellular network connection345,350.The TCU may receive request-response commands from the fleet management system, as depicted inFIG.9In response to such commands, the TCU can obtain data from vehicle sensors and systems, and provide responsive data communication to the fleet management system. Where the command entails activating a vehicle system, for example, a command to flash the lights or to open the door locks, the TCU may communicate with the appropriate system or device, initiate the requested action, inform the management system that the command was executed, and confirm the status of such system after executing the command (e.g., doors are now unlocked).The TCU may also monitor sensors for event triggered actions, such as a low battery indication or a crash indication. When these indications are noted, the TCU automatically transmits a signal with the appropriate data to the fleet management system, where appropriate responses, such as scheduling the vehicle for maintenance or repairs, can be initiated.An entire fleet of vehicles may be equipped with TCUs in accordance with the present invention, enabling the fleet management system to monitor the vehicles, collect data, execute commands within vehicles, and manage the vehicle fleet. The management system can be configured as a centralized system, or a distributed system. It can be operated in whole or in part in the cloud or on a series of servers. The fleet management system can include a plurality of sub-systems, including vehicle rental reservation management, vehicle sharing reservation management, fleet management, and vehicle maintenance management.The TCU processor can control the TCU components to allow for easy integration into different types of vehicles. Therefore, although the TCU of the present invention is expressly intended for use with automobiles, it can be installed in other types of equipment such as, but not limited to, motorcycles, trucks, buses, trains, watercraft, aircraft, and the like.The processor can also monitor TCU power consumption and limit consumption of power when desirable. For example, when the vehicle is experiencing normal operations, the TCU collects and transmits data to, and receives instructions from, the management system. However, when an extended period of vehicle non-use is detected, the TCU may initiate a low-power mode where the TCU minimizes data collection, and cellular communications are curtailed in order to limit the risk of vehicle battery drain. However, even in a low-power mode, cellular communications should be initiated periodically so that the device can receive programming and related information. In the event that the TCU is disconnected from the OBD II port, the TCU may enter an extreme low power mode, for example, where it communicates with the management system solely to report that its location and an indication that it has been disconnected from the OBD II port.The TCU of the present invention may be programmed so that a vehicle can be operated in different vehicle modes. The system, methods and apparatus of the present invention enable the device to be toggled between these different modes through a number of different actions, including via pre-programmed instructions, commands issued by the management system, or in response to certain actions of an authorized person. Accordingly, vehicles equipped with these TCUs may be used in multiple fleet programs, or switched from one fleet or program to another to in response to demand. In these different modes, different vehicle operations may be permitted or curtailed. For example, the TCU may be programmed to operate in a “rental mode,” where the vehicle is available as part of a rental program. The TCU may be programmed, when a vehicle first enters this mode, such that the doors are unlocked, the starter is enabled, and the alarm is disconnected, as the vehicle would normally be located at a rental facility and controlled by the fleet manager. This vehicle may be accessed by a user holding a rental reservation, started with a traditional car key, and driven off a lot after the driver's identification is confirmed. In this mode, vehicle data such as mileage and gas levels are monitored and transmitted periodically to the fleet management system. At the completion of the rental period, when the vehicle is returned to the rental lot, the TCU may be programmed to transmit final mileage and fuel levels to the management system for invoicing/billing purposes. Completion of a rental reservation may be noted automatically when the vehicle arrives at the lot via an RF enabled TCU or via the GPS system, or manually by a lot attendant.The TCU may also be toggled to a “sharing mode.” In the sharing mode, the TCU may be programmed such that the vehicle doors are locked, the vehicle starter is disabled, and the alarm is activated, as vehicles in a sharing program are typically stored in a location that is not controlled by the fleet manager. In the sharing mode, a user may access the vehicle and enable the starter without a key, for example, by waving an access card key over the vehicle card reader. Other access methods may also be utilized. The TCU confirms that the access action is authorized by matching the received data with data transmitted by the management system to the TCU in advance of the sharing reservation period.FIG.4shows an exemplary flow chart wherein a vehicle TCU is toggled to a rental mode400. In this mode, the vehicle is stored in a rental lot, which is typically a controlled location. Here, the vehicle may be left unlocked, with the starter enabled, so that the user may gain easy access and start the vehicle. In this mode, the TCU enables theengine starter410, disables theaccess control device420, such as a card reader, and unlocks thedoors430. When the rental period begins, a user accesses thevehicle440, and starts theengine450. The TCU notes that the doors were accessed and the vehicle started and transmits this data to themanagement system460. The TCU may also inform the management system of the vehicle fuel level and odometer reading, and any other pertinent data that the system operator or owner desires the fleet management system to collect. If the lot includes an exit agent, data may be transmitted to that agent so that the driver's identification may be checked. In the alternative, the exit gate may be opened via the local communication capability previously described. The TCU operating in conjunction with the GPS unit may also report that the vehicle is leaving the rental lot location.During the rental period, data may be collected, monitored, and transmitted by the TCU, in accordance with rental mode programming, as described elsewhere herein. At the conclusion of therental period470, for example, when the GPS unit detects that the vehicle has entered a rental facility, the TCU will inform the management system of the vehicle location and will report vehicle odometer andfuel level readings480. This data may be used by the management system when it generates an invoice for the rental contract. Once the rental period has concluded, the TCU will check whether the vehicle is to remain in rental mode, or if it is to be toggled to theshare mode490. If the vehicle is to remain in rental mode, the TCU may confirm that the doors have been left unlocked. If the doors have been locked, the TCU may automatically unlock the doors.FIG.5shows an exemplary flow chart wherein a vehicle is toggled to and operating in a sharing mode. First, a sharingreservation500is received by the system. At the appropriate time, typically before a user seeks to access the vehicle, information about the reservation is downloaded to the TCU of the vehicle associated with thereservation505. In this manner, the user associated with the reservation can access the vehicle with a card key (or other access device) at the appropriate time, even where the TCU is out of communication with the management system. If the vehicle is being put into sharing mode, the TCU locks the doors and disables thestarter510. At the appropriate time, the TCU enables sharing mode access functions515, such as the card reader. When the assigned user seeks to access the vehicle using anappropriate access method520, the share period starts. Access to the vehicle is provided and the starter is enabled525. During the share period, data may be collected, monitored and transmitted by the TCU, in accordance with sharing mode programming. When the share period ends, and the user leaves thevehicle530, the TCU ensures that the doors are locked and disables thestarter535. The TCU also transmits certain data to themanagement system540, such as vehicle mileage, fuel level and reservation start and end times. Thereafter, the management system determines whether the vehicle is to stay in sharingmode545. If so, the process is repeated for the next sharing reservation. If it is determined that the vehicle is to be toggled to therental mode550, programming associated with the rental mode is transmitted to the TCU so that vehicle operational functions, and desired TCU data collection and transmission protocols, can be initiated. Once the rental mode ends560, the management system repeats the process of determining whether the vehicle is to stay in rental mode or be toggled to the sharing mode.A user may access a vehicle and start a share reservation via a card key, a mobile device or other technology such as a fingerprint scan or entry of an appropriate code on an access panel. Once the TCU determines that the access attempt is valid and associated with the reservation, access will be permitted. The user can thereafter drive away in the vehicle. If the access attempt is not authenticated, such as where the card key is not authorized, access will not be permitted and the starter will remain disabled. If access is permitted, the TCU will inform the management system that access was gained via the method utilized, and that the vehicle has left the storage location. If the vehicle is in a garage, the TCU may be unable to communicate with the management system because a cellular connection is unavailable. In such case, the TCU may be programmed to permit access to and vehicle operation by the cardholder associated with the received reservation information, and will report access and operation to the management system as soon as communication is re-established. If communication is not re-established within a certain period of time after access and operation begins, further operation of the vehicle may be curtailed.When a sharing reservation is concluded, the TCU will inform the management system where the vehicle is located and will confirm that the doors have been locked. In the event that the doors are not locked, or if the trunk is left open, the TCU may be programmed to flash the vehicle lights and/or honk the horn to remind the user to close the trunk and/or lock the doors. The doors may also be automatically locked by the TCU if the car is set to remain in sharing mode and the TCU determines that they are unlocked.A vehicle TCU can be toggled into different modes in a variety of ways. The fleet management system can designate different vehicles for different programs according to demand, as reservations are taken for different programs or in advance based upon known demand patterns. For example, in New York City, business travelers utilize rental vehicles during weekdays and local residents utilize shared vehicles during weekends. In accordance with the present invention, vehicles can be toggled between both programs to accommodate this demand by designating certain vehicles for use in the sharing program during weekends, and for use in the rental program during weekdays.The fleet management system may toggle a TCU upon command, such as when a user without a reservation arrives at a facility to rent or share a vehicle. A TCU may also be toggled in response to a user action, such as when a fleet management employee with certain privileges tries to access a vehicle via the card reader. If the card holder has appropriate privileges, the vehicle may be toggled to the appropriate mode automatically by the TCU, and access provided immediately. The mode can also be changed by fleet personnel via Bluetooth or NFC enabled mobile technology. Further, the mode can be set automatically based upon the location of a vehicle via RF or cellular communication between the TCU and the facility or the management system, such as when a vehicle arrives at a location associated with a particular program.It is envisioned that the TCU could be set for additional modes, including modes not described herein. In each case, sensor data and communication appropriate for that mode may be collected and transmitted by the TCU. For example, a vehicle might be toggled for use a corporate or municipal pool for a certain period of time. In these modes, the TCU can enable (or preclude) vehicle access via an access card. Programming might not require transmission of fuel level data to the management system, as such data might not be necessary for vehicles assigned to a corporate pool for a period of time. On the other hand, a mode could be created for a specific entity wherein fuel level data is electronically reported to that entity after each use of each vehicle so that the entity can manage refueling of all vehicles in the fleet.If a vehicle is operated as part of a corporate fleet, or is operated in regions of the country or world where travel into certain areas is restricted, such as locations near a border, the TCU mode can utilize geo-fencing to ensure that the vehicle is operated only within permitted regions. In the event such programming is implemented, and a user seeks to take a vehicle to a region that is not permitted, the management system will detect this movement via the location provided by the GPS unit, and a violation of the “fenced” territory can be triggered. Further, via two-way communication with the TCU, the management system could prohibit such travel, for example, by immobilizing the vehicle if a user enters prohibited territory. Geo-fencing could be executed within the TCU, if sufficient memory and processing capability is provided, or within the fleet management system, working in conjunction with GPS data supplied by the TCU. For certain types of fleets, GPS could be used, consistent with applicable laws and disclosure requirements, to monitor or track routes taken by drivers, or the timing of certain activities, which may be essential information in a corporate or municipal program.If the vehicle is to be used outside the United States, such as in the European Community, laws and current practices may require different programming. For example, in certain countries, it is essential that vehicle doors remain locked whenever a vehicle is parked. In other countries, users may access a vehicle with a card key, and subsequently access a vehicle with a key stored in a storage compartment within the vehicle. Further, collection and transmission of certain reservation data, location data, or driving habits may be restricted in certain parts of the world. By toggling the vehicle TCU to a mode created specifically for use of the vehicle in such country or region, the invention enables a fleet manager to comply with such laws and practices as needed, while not restricting the use of the vehicle to that location or program. As can be seen, use of a programmable TCU, which can operate in different vehicle modes to provide different TCU functionality at different points in time on a vehicle by vehicle basis, enables a single fleet of vehicles to be used in a variety of different vehicle programs. This enables the fleet owner to more efficiently manage use of fleet vehicles.FIG.6provides an exemplary flow chart showing the steps that may be undertaken to install and activate a TCU. First, the TCU is attached beneath the vehicle dashboard and plugged into thevehicle600. Next, the TCU will initiate a power on self-test605. If the device is faulty, a fault light or alarm is activated610. If the TCU passes the test, the TCU will readvehicle VIN information615. Next, the TCU transmits the VIN, together with TCU IMEI and SIM information, to themanagement system620. In the alternative, the system may check for a difference between that VIN and the last VIN on record in the TCU. If there is no change in VIN, no further action is taken.In the management system, it is determined if there is a vehicle corresponding to the VIN in thefleet inventory625. If so, the management system will associate the TCU with theappropriate vehicle630, and transmit appropriate instructions to operate the TCU in the vehicle make and model in which it is installed. If the VIN is not recognized, or if the IMEI or SIM is not recognized, the system flags the TCU data for further evaluation and notifies the installer of thediscrepancy635. Thereafter, the management system sets theTCU mode640, and notifies the installer that installation is complete645. The TCU may inform the installer that installation is complete via certain actions in the car, such as flashing the lights, changing the status of a TCU LED, or activating the car horn.FIG.7depicts a chart showing de-installation of a TCU. When a TCU is to be disconnected, service personnel would normally inform the management system that the vehicle is going into aservice mode700. When the TCU is unplugged from thevehicle710, the TCU transmits a signal to the management system noting that it has been unplugged, along with the last VIN on record, the TCU IMEI, the current time, the battery voltage andGPS location720. The management system thereafter verifies that disconnection was intended. If so, the TCU is listed in a table of TCUs not currently installed. Where intended, the SIM associated with the TCU may be placed in an idle mode, so that further data charges are restricted725. If TCU disconnection was not authorized, the disconnection can be flagged for further action.FIGS.8A and8Bdepict representative data that may be communicated by the TCU upon mode switch, or as needed, respectively. As shown inFIG.8A, a TCU may be programmed so that when it is toggled to amode800, such as rental mode or share mode, it will transmit certain data andinformation810, including, but not limited to, the following: IMEI, odometer reading, vehicle battery level, fuel level, and malfunction indicator lamp. The TCU can be programmed to transmit the same or different data when the TCU is first put into a new mode, depending on system needs and the data desired in such mode. As depicted inFIG.8B, the TCU may be programmed to transmit certain data and information on an event driven basis. At850the TCU detects a new event. The TCU determines, according to TCU programming, whether that event needs to be transmitted to themanagement system860. If the event needs to be transmitted, the TCU sends the sensor data (including any additional data that programming requires it to send) to themanagement system870along with the TCU IMEI information or the vehicle VIN. The TCU may send additional relevant data, such as, but not limited to, door status, ignition status, tire pressure, headlight sense, diagnostic trouble codes, and malfunction indicator lamp status.FIG.9depicts exemplary steps undertaken by the invention in connection with command-response communications through which a user or a system administrator may remotely command the TCU to take some action. In this example, a request can be made by auser900via a mobile device in communication with theTCU905, via communication between the user and thefleet management system910, or via communication between the user and a person havingadministrator privileges915. A person withappropriate privileges915could also initiate a command via thefleet management system910or via a RF command. Once a command is initiated, it is communicated to theTCU930directly via local communication, or via acellular network connection920/925. The TCU then executes the command via the OBDII port connection940or via hard-wiredcircuit connection935. These connections enable the TCU to obtain sensor data or activate a vehicle device orsystem945, such as door locks, vehicle lights, the horn, and the like. Once the command is activated, the TCU may also confirm that the command has been activated and provide responsive or confirmation information, such as sensor data or system status to the management system. Thus, the TCU may report that the doors are locked/unlocked, the lights have been flashed, the horn activated, and the like.Command-response actions may be limited in accordance with the operable TCU mode. For example, in rental mode, users may be prohibited from activating commands, or certain administrator commands may be prohibited, such as locking of doors or activating the alarm. The fleet management system may also prohibit certain command-response actions by location. For example, a facility manager in one location may be precluded from initiating certain actions or obtaining data from a TCU in a vehicle located at a distant location.The data communicated by the TCU enables a fleet operator to manage the vehicle fleet in numerous ways. For example, sensor status and data can be transmitted by the TCU modem via the cellular network to the fleet management system where it can be accessed, analyzed, and shared with the other systems. For vehicles in a rental fleet, or when vehicles are being operated in a rental mode, ease of access can be assured, and applicable data such as fuel level and mileage can be automatically sensed and transmitted to the management system, integrated into a vehicle rental record, and incorporated into a rental invoice generated at the conclusion of a rental, thus removing the requirement that a rental system employee manually check the fuel status and mileage.Where vehicle sensors detect vehicle components requiring maintenance, such as a low battery indication, the fleet management system can interface with electronic maintenance and repair systems to schedule the vehicle for appropriate and timely maintenance or repair, as described below. The system can also ensure that no reservations are made for that vehicle during the period of scheduled maintenance. Notification of repairs needing immediate attention can also be provided to the user.If certain sensors indicate a vehicle emergency has occurred, such as a collision, the management system can detect these conditions and notify fleet administrators so that appropriate action can be taken, such as notifying authorities. In the event that an emergency is detected, GPS location data can be automatically transmitted, or requested and obtained from the TCU, so that local emergency responders can be dispatched to the vehicle location reported by the GPS system.Where accelerometer readings exceed thresholds, the TCU can communicate this information to the management system, where further analysis of sensor data can be undertaken to determine where the user has engaged in inappropriate driving behavior. If so, the management system may then flag the vehicle for physical inspection for evidence of vehicle misuse or damage. The fleet management system may also store sensor data and other information in order to evaluate driver behavior and driving characteristics for a wide variety of purposes. For example, this data could be used for a rating system, in which future vehicle pricing or insurance coverage requirements are based upon behavior patterns noted for a particular type of vehicle, in a given location, at a given time of year. Consistent with current law and disclosure requirements, such data could be used for preferred pricing, discounts and other bonuses for drivers who exhibit safe driving characteristics. Similarly, drivers who exhibit certain behaviors may be barred from future vehicle use, or may be notified that inappropriate or improper use of the vehicle has been detected.Sensor data may also be used to monitor vehicle performance for maximizing fleet economics. Vehicle operational data and information, such as oil sensor data and fuel economy readings, may be utilized in connection with fleet vehicle maintenance. Vehicle use conditions can also be monitored such that vehicles driven in heavy traffic, or in geographic regions with excessive dust, can be scheduled for more frequent maintenance. Sensor data can also be used in connection with economic decisions, such as determining which vehicles are subject to greater abuse or higher accident rates. Such information can be used by the fleet owner in connection with vehicle use pricing decisions, vehicle and user insurance decisions, and in determining whether certain vehicles should be discontinued from a fleet.Programmable two-way communication between the TCU and the management system further enables the fleet operator to provide numerous value-added services for fleet customers. For example, for electric vehicles in a fleet, the TCU can monitor battery levels and remind a user via a mobile device when a charge is required. If so, the system may direct the user to a nearby charging location. The TCU can also report battery levels to the management system, enabling the management system to determine whether the vehicle will need to be recharged before it is provided to the next user. In sharing mode, the management system may utilize battery level information to direct the user to an available charging location at the time of vehicle return to ensure that vehicle charging takes place in advance of the next use of the vehicle. If the user cannot locate a vehicle, the TCU can be commanded to activate the car lights or the horn. In the event that a parking space is not available to a share customer seeking to return a vehicle, the TCU and/or the management system may detect the location of the user via the GPS system, and direct the user to a nearby alternate lot. The management system could also utilize vehicle GPS data transmitted through the TCU to direct a user to nearby available parking spaces during a rental or share period. The system could provide similar notification for available nearby fleet facilities, such as cleaning or maintenance facilities. Finally, in-vehicle systems such as a satellite radio system, a GPS/navigation system, or an entertainment system may be activated remotely via management system communication with the TCU, such as where there is a wired or wireless connection between the in-vehicle system and the TCU, including the vehicle CAN bus and OBD II port.One skilled in the art will appreciate that the fleet management system described herein can utilize servers and databases located on one or more computers and in storage media and devices at one or more locations, including a central computing system, such as a mainframe computing system, or a distributed computing environment where various tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. These can include public, private, or hybrid cloud computing network environments. In a distributed computing environment, program modules can be located in both local and remote computer systems, and in storage media and devices. The management system can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computing devices, such as, for example, a personal computer, a portable computer, a mainframe computer, a server, a network computer, a cloud-based application or computing device, a mobile device, a peer device or another common network node, and so on. Logical connections between the computer and a remote computing device can be made via a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.CAN ScriptingAs discussed above, the management system can be configured to transmit firmware upgrades and programming to TCUs. In several embodiments, the system uses a CAN scripting engine for efficiently updating TCUs without requiring firmware upgrades so that they may properly identify and handle information received from the CAN bus on various vehicles. Information can be obtained from the CAN bus passively1420(i.e., listening to exchanges between ECUs of the vehicle and gathering relevant information) or actively1410(i.e., actively requesting data using Parameter ID requests). Obtaining this information requires knowledge of the particular codes used for that particular vehicle, which must be written in the firmware for that installed TCU. This information varies between vehicle makes, models, and years, and also can be changed by the manufacturer from time to time. Typically, as new makes, models and years of vehicles are added to a fleet, the firmware in existing TCUs in the fleet must corresponding be upgraded or updated.The CAN scripting engine avoids the need to upgrade the firmware directly. It comprises an assembler-like language with an instruction set that translates to CAN actions and processing of relevant messages from the CAN bus or ECUs. A series of scripts are created with instructions specific for a particular make/model/year of vehicle, and are maintained and stored in a central storage repository. Each script has instructions for one or more CAN operations for the associated vehicle, and are abstracted from the hardware architecture. One or more scripts can be compiled and transmitted to TCUs that are installed in vehicles corresponding to the associated vehicle for the script. Scripts can thus be automatically deployed to appropriate TCUs based on the installed vehicle. The TCU then process the scripts to either listen to1420orrequest1410data from the CAN bus, and processes the results accordingly1470.Script instructions may include one or more of the following: standard CAN operations (e.g., Listen for message, Request PID, Send); basic arithmetic operations (e.g., Add, Subtract, Multiply, Bit shift and operations); external calls (e.g., Set fuel to, Set odometer to, and the like; and control logic (e.g., Jump if equal, more, and the like). The scripting engine allows the fleet management system to more easily send and receive data from fleet vehicles while minimizing the adverse impact of different standards, document, and hardware capabilities within a diverse fleet.Vehicle Use OperationsThe present invention further comprises one or more systems for vehicle use operations, including, but not limited to, enrolling or registering users, scheduling or reserving vehicles for approved or authorized users, monitoring the vehicle while being used, predicting vehicle arrival or return times and locations (including the identification of likely late returns), and processing vehicle returns. Types of users vary depending on the nature of the fleet. For example, users may be employees of the owner of a corporate or municipal utility fleet, authorized drivers of a bus fleet, drivers of taxi-cabs, renters or customers of a car rental agency, or members of a car sharing service. Accordingly, the types of vehicle use operation systems used above will vary as well.In several embodiments, the present invention comprises a user enrollment or registration component. This component reviews potential users backgrounds and qualifications, including, but not limited to, user training, licensure reviews, background checks, and credit checks, as appropriate. In some business models, enrollment may comprise an application and acceptance as a member of a car sharing or similar service. Advertising or other means of solicitation of potential users may be included. In some cases, users may not be previously enrolled prior to an initial reservation or use, and some or all of these checks may be performed at the time the user reserves a vehicle or initially takes possession of a vehicle. Users of a particular fleet may be divided into different categories or classifications (e.g., a preferred or frequent driver program for a car rental company, or users licensed for certain types of vehicles).The present invention further comprises a vehicle scheduling or reservation component. This comprises both user-facing and internal fleet system elements. Examples of a reservations interface for a user to identify available vehicles and make a reservation are provided in U.S. Pub. No. 2013/0226633 (published Aug. 29, 2013 by Zipcar, Inc.) and U.S. Pub. No. 2011/0060480 (published Mar. 10, 2011 by Zipcar, Inc.), which are incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.In several exemplary embodiments, the present invention comprises a multi-tiered fleet management reservations database caching system, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,576,254 (issued Feb. 21, 2017 to Zipcar, Inc.), which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes. As described therein, a database on a first computing system contains operational status data describing whether each particular object or asset (e.g., a vehicle in a connected fleet) is functionally operational, and reservation data describing the availability of that object for a reservation by a pre-authorized user, such as a member of a vehicle sharing service. A first caching level, implemented on the first computer system, creates a first cache of dense, time-windowed data by receiving, from the database, operation status data and reservation from a window or period of time, and converting the data to form windowed denser data. A second caching level, also implemented on the first computer system, creates a second cache of compact data by storing the dense windowed data from the first cache in a simple set data structure. A plurality of third caches are then created by copying the second cache, and are subsequently provided to one or more application computing systems separate from the first computer system, thereby allowing a connected end user with a computing device to access the data in a third cache without accessing the first computer system. The system is managed and updated such that the amount of time that data in the caches is different is minimized.The present invention further comprises a vehicle access component, that also may both user-facing and internal fleet system elements. This may be part of the reservations system, or work in conjunction with a reservations system. The user seeks access in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, obtaining keys to the vehicle from a car rental agent, presenting an authorized user card to a card reader in the vehicle, or using a mobile computing device to communicate with a TCU or dedicated access unit in the vehicle, as discussed above. Examples of access control systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,442,888 (issued Sep. 13, 2016 to Zipcar, Inc.) and U.S. Pat. No. 9,635,518 (issued Apr. 25, 2017 to Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC), which are incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.In cases where the user is attempting key-less access to a connected vehicle, such as by wireless communication with a user's mobile computing device, there are several methods to determine whether to allow access. In some cases, access may be permitted if the user is a pre-authorized registered user and presents a general access code or authorization to the vehicle. In other cases, reservation data (either for a single reservation or for reservations over a period of time, which can be a day or several days) has been previously electronically communicated to the vehicle (e.g., transmitted to a TCU in the vehicle) and stored therein, and access is permitted if a user attempting access matches corresponding reservation data (i.e., user identity, time period, and the like). Alternatively, after receiving an access request from a user, the vehicle (i.e., through TCU or similar unit) electronically communicates with the fleet management system to confirm whether or not to allow access. In cases where the vehicle cannot establish direct communication access, it may attempt to establish communication through other connected vehicles, through the user's mobile device, or other wireless access points.Offline AccessIn some cases or circumstances, such as an underground garage or parking area, the fleet vehicle and user's computing device may be unable to establish outside communications links in any fashion. Similarly, a fleet vehicle may be located in a high-latency or low-coverage area, with intermittent, erratic or low-quality communications links. This prevents or interferes with normal user access to vehicles with access controlled by telematics units, as the telematics unit usually must be in direct wireless communication with the system server to request and receive reservation information, and to validate the requests or commands for access and other functions relayed from a user computing device.In several embodiments, the fleet management system of the present invention previously provides a protected, secure, single-use token or object to the user's mobile computing device upon making a reservation (or, in some cases, at a later time close to the starting time of the reservation), which is securely communicated via direct local communication from the user's device to the vehicle's telematics unit (or similar control unit). The vehicle's telematics unit processes the token/object and allows access if the information in the token is valid and authenticated. This avoids the use of an additional dedicated badge or card reader in the vehicle, the distribution and replacement of badges or cards to individual users, and concomitant costs for installation and maintenance.In one embodiment, as seen inFIG.19, when a user creates a booking orreservation1510with the system server for a selected vehicle, the system server creates a digitally-signedreservation object1520and transmits it to the user's mobile device (e.g., cell phone, smart phone, tablet, and the like)1530. The reservation object contains information about the reservation (e.g., start time, end time, parking locations, vehicle telematics unit identification number, and the like), as well as a unique reservation identification number or code that is encrypted with the telematics unit key. The user's mobile device stores the reservation object in computer storage media/memory in the device. (It should be noted that while a typical reservation is made for a particular vehicle, a “soft” booking or reservation may sometimes be made for more than one vehicle, e.g., a car group, and thus multiple reservation objects may be sent for multiple vehicles that may be covered by the reservation.)In an exemplary embodiment, the unique reservation identification number or code is a temporary, random reservation key value of a set size (e.g., 4 bytes, 8 bytes, or larger) generated by the server during the reservation process, unique to that reservation, and transmitted in hash form to the user's mobile device with the packet or packets of reservation data. This reservation key value does not need to be known in advance by the telematics unit in the reserved vehicle, and while stored on the mobile device, is not processed or analyzed by the mobile device.At or near the time of the reservation, the user then attempts to locate the vehicle, which is located in an areas without outside communications links (or with limited communications)1540. When the user's mobile device is in proximity of the reserved vehicle, communication between the device and vehicle is established via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or similar connection. In some embodiments, the telematics unit advertises its presence with short range broadcasting of limited data including its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity number, which is typically unique to the device). The user's mobile device uses the stored reservation data to search for and detect whether a vehicle with a telematics unit with matching IMEI is in range (or vehicles with matching IMEIs, in the case of a reservation covering multiple vehicles, as described above). The mobile device does not need to receive a full list of all vehicle IMEIs from the system server. The BLE module on telematics unit uses LE Privacy (i.e., generation of random MAC addresses). LE Privacy also is enabled on the user's mobile device, and cannot be disabled. The user device transmits the reservation data to the vehicle's telematics unit (or corresponding control unit)1550. This transmission may be done without user action, provided a system reservation or access application is running on the mobile device.In one exemplary embodiment, the initial BLE transmission from the user device comprises a data packet incorporating a message, the message comprising the IMEI of the telematics unit the data packet is valid for, the timestamp of the time the reservation r booking was created on the system server, and a synchronization variable listing comprising the particular reservation data as well as other upcoming events for the specific vehicle. The data packet comprises several additional fields, including, but not limited to, the following: type (type and format of the message, which define the algorithms used to compute the signature of the message), length (length of the message or the synchronization variable component in the message, typically in bytes), and digital signature of the message encrypted using the system server's private key.The telematics unit in the vehicle then attempts to verify that the reservation is, in fact, for the particular car andtelematics unit1560. The telematics unit first verifies the digital signature of the reservation object (in relation to the public certificate of the system server). If the signature is not verified, the data packet is discarded. The unit then compares the IMEI field in the data packet with its local IMEI; if the IMEIs do not match, the data packet is discarded. The unit then verifies that the timestamp in the data packet is valid; if not valid, the data packet is discarded. If all of the above checks are passed, the data packet is processed and the unit's internal synchronization variable listing data is updated or replaced.Upon confirmation of the reservation data, the telematics unit then presents to the mobile device a random challenge involving the unique reservation identification, which the application on the mobile device solves and then presents the solution back to thetelematics unit1570. After the telematics unit validates the presented solution, it marks the BLE connection as authenticated, and then accepts certain commands (e.g., unlock/lock, immobilize/de-immobilize, honk, flash lights, end ride) from the mobile device through the authenticatedBLE connection1580.While the mobile device and the telematics unit may encrypt the BLE link, in several embodiments link encryption is not necessary, thereby avoiding requiring the user to accept BLE encryption pairing for each vehicle. The random challenge process described above will prevent a hacker or third party spying on the BLE connection from replaying the commands, as the hacker or third party will not be able to solve the random challenge. The system thereby provides a BLE secure channel by pairing the devices together and using an out of band mechanism to ensure the identity of the devices.Use MonitoringAfter access is allowed, the period of use commences. During use, as described above, the connected vehicle (or a TCU or a similar unit in the vehicle) provides various types of information to the fleet management system. The fleet management system may directly or indirectly monitor some or all of the period of use.In several embodiments, the fleet management system monitors the period of use for emergency situations, which may be reported by the user through the user's mobile devices or a unit in the vehicle, or reported automatically by the vehicle through its sensors, as described above. Communications can be established directly with the user, and road-side assistance or emergency response may be called and provided. If communications cannot be established directly with the user, and depending on the information available from vehicle or TCU sensors, road-side assistance or emergency response may be automatically called.In several embodiments, the user may communicate an incident or accident in real-time during the use period. Information may be gathered in real time, including descriptions and pictures of any damage to the vehicle. This information can then be provided to the fleet management system's servicing or maintenance components for advance planning and scheduling prior to return of the vehicle.The fleet management system further provides predictive modeling to determine when a vehicle will arrive at one or more destinations or stopping points. This may be used, for example, to provide accurate determinations of when a vehicle, such as a shuttle bus, will arrive at a particular stop or terminal. It may also be used for the early detection of a possible late return of a vehicle, as described in U.S. Pub. No. 2013/0246102 (published Sep. 19, 2013 by Zipcar, Inc.) which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.Depending on the size of the fleet, tracking the location of all vehicles in the fleet requires processing an extremely large amount of data, which may exceed processing capabilities for a particular system or may unacceptably slow operational speed. In these cases, the system may actively focus on vehicles based on time and/or distance parameters. For example, the current location and speed of a vehicle may only be polled within a set period (e.g., one hour, two hours, or similar threshold) of an expected or scheduled arrival or return time. Alternatively, or in addition, the system may identify a vehicle of interest based on the relative distance from the nearest location where the vehicle may be returned, such as car rental return location.In one embodiment, the present invention uses a predictive geo-tile location algorithm to determine the distance of a vehicle from any relevant connected fleet location (such as a car rental return location), and notify the vehicle when it next needs to send location coordinates based on the relative distance from the nearest such location. As seen inFIG.10, this embodiment creates pre-determined “geo-tiles” on a map, and determines the particular geo-tile that a vehicle is in based on the most recently received GPS coordinates from the vehicle. It then determines all adjacent geo-tiles that are within a predictive search variable radius around the current vehicle location. It then determines if a relevant connected fleet location is found within any geo-tile within that radius. If so, the system determines if the vehicle is within any particular geo-fence location (e.g., a parking lot at a car rental return location). If the vehicle is found in a known geo-fenced location, appropriate return action is taken (e.g., the car rental return location is notified, and the return/check-in process is enabled). If the vehicle is not within a known geo-fenced location, the system then determines the distance to the closest fleet location, determines the next polling interval (i.e., the time when the vehicle should next send vehicle GPS location data) based on that distance, and notifies the vehicle of the polling interval. In general, shorter distances require shorter polling intervals.If no relevant connected fleet location is found with any geo-tile within the predictive search variable radius, then the system sets the polling interval to a longer period based on the size of the radius. In general, larger radii call for longer polling intervals.The present invention further comprises vehicle return applications or components, which handle, among other things, determination of the vehicle status and condition, invoicing of the user (where appropriate), and forwarding of the vehicle for any servicing, maintenance or repairs that may be required. These also may comprise user-facing and internal fleet elements.In several embodiments, the system comprises a vehicle return application or component, which can take the form of an application on a mobile computing device, as seen inFIGS.11-16. The return application is used to process the return of a fleet vehicle, including the detecting and recording (such as by digital images or videos) of damage to the vehicle (internal or external), and the need for maintenance of one or more vehicle components or systems. The user can indicate specific external damage locations on a diagram, and can interactively choose the components damaged. In some embodiments, a smart vehicle detection and recording process is used. Incident or accident reports can be digitally recorded, as seen inFIGS.16, in order to avoid the rekeying of data where possible.In several embodiments, the system may automatically, in real time, calculate a damage charge to add the user or customer's invoice at the time of return. The mobile device may be used to capture the electronic signature of the customer or user returning the vehicle, including the damage charge. A receipt can be emailed to the customer. The system then performs, in real time, an automated comparison of the vehicle condition against an established vehicle standard or standards, such as, but not limited to, a vehicle rentable standard or a vehicle operating standard. When the established vehicle standard is not met, the vehicle is automatically placed “out of service.” If a rental fleet vehicle, for example, the vehicle then cannot be rented.The system then performs, in real time, an automated comparison of the vehicle condition against an established vehicle standard or standards, such as, but not limited to, a vehicle rentable standard or a vehicle operating standard. When the established vehicle standard is not met, the vehicle is automatically placed “out of service.” If a rental fleet vehicle, for example, the vehicle then cannot be rented. The system may then automatically direct the vehicle to servicing, maintenance or repair, as necessary, based on the vehicle condition information.Vehicle Servicing, Maintenance and RepairIn several embodiment, the present invention comprises a servicing scheduling component, which provides servicing staff with schedules or task lists of various services that are required for one or more vehicles. The servicing staff member notifies the system when the task or tasks for a particular vehicle have been completed.In several embodiments, a maintenance application receives information from the return application identifying maintenance or repair issues. In additional embodiments, the maintenance application allows the capture of maintenance and/or damage problems or issues that arise outside of vehicle rental or use, and thus would not be captured by the vehicle return process.The system then automatically creates a repair or maintenance order based on the vehicle condition information (including information gathered upon vehicle return, if applicable). The system may automatically direct a repair to the most cost effective supplier based on the total cost and other parameters of the repair, including, but not limited to, repair time, logistics, expenses, and similar factors.A vehicle repair may be managed through the repair management portal (as seen inFIG.17). The system allows users to obtain quotes for work, review and execute work and purchase orders, review and approve invoices (including e-invoices), evaluate supplier performance, and perform similar tasks. The system can prepare and display a prioritized “to-do” list of maintenance and repair tasks, and track all work performed and completed (including, but not limited to, a post-repair or post-maintenance inspection). Documentation of system tasks and functions is maintained automatically.In several embodiments, the system can automatically decide the order of repair or maintenance (e.g., what gets repaired, when it gets repaired, and how it gets repaired). The system also can interact with business operation systems (such as a rental fleet management reservation system) to tactically address and possibly release additional vehicles at peak times as needed.The system of the present invention thus provides the ability to track vehicle condition at each vehicle movement or check-points, and helps avoid missed damage and damage charges. It avoids the manually-intensive and inefficient rekeying of incident and damage details multiple times, thereby providing an efficient system to track and manage vehicle damage repair. It speeds the overall repair process, particularly removing inefficiencies caused by delayed handover of vehicles to various members of the supply chain. It further provides a consistent standard for vehicle rental or operating condition, which can be automatically determined, resulting in an improved customer experience.Vehicle Allocation and TransferIn several embodiments, the present invention provides for pro-active fleet planning and management of existing vehicles. Various predictive programs are used to determine vehicle use patterns and trends over various time periods, and the system may direct the movement of various fleet vehicles from one location to another location based on these predictions. Fleet movement may be accomplished by bulk transport means (e.g., multiple vehicles loaded on a truck), or by strategic pricing for users seeking to pick up a vehicle at a first location and drop it off at a second location. In the latter case, the system may provide strategic pricing for particular vehicles that the system determines should be moved to the second location.Fleet vehicles also may be transferred from fleet to fleet, or between components of a fleet. A TCU or similar unit as described above enables the rapid and easy transfer of a vehicle between fleets or components.Examples of systems and methods for sharing vehicles between fleets are disclosed in U.S. Pub. No. 2015/0294403 (published Oct. 15, 2015 by Zipcar, Inc.), which is incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.Vehicle De-FleetingFleet vehicles also may be removed from a fleet, and returned to a lessor or manufacturer, or sold to a third party. In these circumstances, the system conducts an analysis of the vehicle condition, and compares to pre-established sales standard (for a third-party sale or auction), or a pre-established lessor or OEM return standard.

       "  'description': \"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThe present application claims priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 120 to, and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/938,799, entitled “Personalization System and Method for a Vehicle Based on Spatial Locations of Occupants' Body Portions”, filed Oct. 7, 2022, which is a continuation of U.S. patent Ser. No. 16/211,901, entitled “Personalization System and Method for a Vehicle Based on Spatial Locations of Occupants' Body Portions”, filed on Dec. 6, 2018, now U.S. Pat. No. 11,465,631, which claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/596,413, entitled “Personalization System and Method for a Vehicle Based on Spatial Locations of Occupants' Body Portions”, filed Dec. 8, 2017, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and made part of the present U.S. Utility patent application for all purposes.TECHNICAL FIELDVarious embodiments of the disclosure relate to automotive technologies. More specifically, various embodiments of the disclosure relate to personalizing vehicle systems to maximize the user experience and also efficiently use vehicle resources, including stored energy, based on spatial locations of vehicle occupants or portions of their.BACKGROUNDVehicle occupant experience and personalization is an important aspect for creating a positive vehicle experience. Currently, vehicle personalization systems and technologies are limited to standard vehicle settings or predefined customizations, where variations in physical body dimensions of different occupants play a negligible role. For example, different occupants of a vehicle may have different physical body sizes or shapes. Therefore, when such different occupants are seated in the vehicle, standard settings or even preset user preferences for different vehicular systems, e.g., climate control systems and in-vehicle audio systems, may not be effectively tailored to each occupant or the current situation. Further, a change in one customized vehicle setting, for example, a seat position, for one occupant may interfere with other settings related to the different vehicular systems for the same occupant. This may hamper the overall in-vehicle comfort and entertainment experience for the occupant, for example, a driver. Further, even a customized setting for one occupant, for example, a driver, may not have no impact on other occupants or worse, may reduce the experience for other occupants in the vehicle. For example, if the driver typically desires all of the speakers to be directed towards the driver's ears to maximize sound quality, the passenger have a reduced experience.Besides impacting the user experience, resources may not be directed in an efficient manner. For example, in an electric vehicle, battery resources may be used to control air temperature. Maximizing the comfort felt by the vehicle occupants allows fewer resources to be used, thereby decreasing energy usage and increasing vehicle range. Thus, an advanced, intelligent, and an automatic real-time or near-real-time personalization system may be desired for vehicles for enhanced in-vehicle comfort and entertainment experience for one or more vehicle occupants.Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of described systems with some aspects of the present disclosure, as set forth in the remainder of the present application and with reference to the drawings.SUMMARYA personalization system and method for a vehicle based on the spatial location of vehicle occupants or portions of their of body is substantially shown in, and/or described in connection with, at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure may be appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the present disclosure, along with the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG.1is a block diagram that illustrates a network environment for personalization system for a vehicle, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.FIG.2is a block diagram that illustrates various exemplary components or systems of a vehicle, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.FIGS.3A to3Fillustrate exemplary scenarios for implementation of the disclosed personalization system and method for a vehicle based on spatial locations of body portions of occupants in the vehicle, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.FIGS.4A,4B,4C, and4Dcollectively, depict a flow chart that illustrates exemplary operations for personalization of a vehicle based on spatial locations of body portions of occupants in the vehicle, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONThe following described implementations may be found in the disclosed personalization system and method for a vehicle based on spatial locations of body portions of occupants in the vehicle.

The image-capture device112may be activated when the vehicle door is opened. The image-capture device112may be configured to capture at least one or more images or a video of thefirst user116A. In some embodiments, the image-capture device112may execute at least one or more face detection algorithms on the captured one or more images or the video to extract facial features for identification of a user, such as thefirst user116A. The image-capture device112may be configured to identify a driver profile associated with thefirst user116A based on facial recognition of thefirst user116A. In some embodiments, instead of facial recognition, other user identification methods, for example, human identification from a body shape based on human object boundary or silhouette matching, may be used. In some embodiments, the in-vehicleelectronic device114, for example, an infotainment head unit or an ECU, may be configured to receive the captured one or more images or the video of thefirst user116A from the image-capture device112, via an in-vehicle network. In such a case, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to process the captured one or more images or the video of thefirst user116A to identify the driver profile associated with thefirst user116A based on facial recognition of thefirst user116A.In cases where thefirst user116A is identified based on facial recognition, a profile associated with the identifiedfirst user116A may be searched in a user profile database stored in a memory device of the in-vehicleelectronic device114. In cases where the profile associated with the identifiedfirst user116A is found, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to communicate an audio signal to a vehicle audio system to output a customized audio greeting to thefirst user116A. For example, the profile offirst user116A may be the driver profile of “Fredrick”. Thefirst user116A may be notified of recognition confirmation with custom audio greeting, “Hello Fredrick” via at least one of the audio speakers of the vehicle audio system.In accordance with an embodiment, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to execute a first level of customization in thevehicle102based on the defined user-preferences in the driver profile of thefirst user116A. For example, the driver seat, vehicle mirrors (e.g. outer rear view mirrors (ORVMs), front mirror, and the like), heating, cooling, and driving mode preferences, may be adjusted in accordance with the user preferences in the driver profile of thefirst user116A. The in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to communicate a plurality of control signals to one or more other in-vehicle systems or ECUs to initiate the adjustments in accordance with the user preferences in the driver profile of thefirst user116A.In cases where thefirst user116A is not identified based on facial recognition, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to mark thefirst user116A as a new user, and a request to set a profile may be generated on a display of an infotainment head unit. In certain scenarios, a plurality of users, such as thefirst user116A and thesecond user116B, may board thevehicle102together for a ride. In such scenarios, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to communicate audio signals to the vehicle audio system to output customized audio greetings for the plurality of users based on a concurrent identification of the plurality of users. For example, in addition to custom audio greeting to thefirst user116A, thesecond user116B may also be greeted as, “Hello Nick, good to see you after a long time”, via an audio speaker that is in vicinity of thesecond user116B. The in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to store a time or a day of boarding, a duration of a trip (or journey), a seating position for each identified user during each trip in the memory. The in-vehicleelectronic device114may be further configured to track and store changes in seating position, user behavior, or body movement for each identified user during each trip for later analysis. Thus, when thesecond user116B is detected to board after a certain period of time, for example, 2-3 months based on the stored last day of boarding for thesecond user116B, the custom audio greeting “Hello Nick, good to see you after a long time” is generated accordingly for a humanized in-vehicle experience.In accordance with an embodiment, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to estimate a plurality of Z-heights of a plurality of body portions of each of the one or more occupants (e.g., thefirst user116A and thesecond user116B). The plurality of Z-heights may be estimated from a reference position in thevehicle102. Examples of the plurality of body portions for which the plurality of Z-heights are estimated, may include, but are not limited to a face portion, middle portion of a face from a left ear to a right ear, or other body portions. The plurality of Z-heights may be estimated based on the plurality of images captured by the image-capture device112. The estimation of the plurality of Z-heights from the reference position in thevehicle102, is described in detail, for example, inFIG.3C. AZ-height of a body portion may correspond to a spatial location of the body portion, such as an occupant's head or ears, of a vehicle occupant in the vehicle when the user is in a seated position.In accordance with an embodiment, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to determine an associative relationship between the estimated plurality of Z-heights of the plurality of the body portions of each occupants in thevehicle102and a plurality of in-vehicle systems. Examples of the plurality of in-vehicle systems may include, but are not limited to the vehicle audio system and a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. In one example, a first Z-height of “X” centimeter (cm), may be estimated from the reference position in thevehicle102to one side (e.g., the lower side) of a face rectangle of the detected facial portion of a first occupant (such as thefirst user116A). The first Z-height, for example, may be associated with the HVAC system of thevehicle102. In another example, a second Z-height of “Y” centimeter (cm) from the reference position to the middle portion of the face rectangle of the first occupant (such as thefirst user116A) may be estimated. The second Z-height, for example, may be associated with the vehicle audio system of thevehicle102.The in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to control the plurality of in-vehicle systems to direct an output from a corresponding in-vehicle system of the plurality of in-vehicle systems to a specific body portion of the plurality of body portions of each of the one or more occupants in thevehicle102. The output from a corresponding in-vehicle system may be directed to the specific body portion based on the estimated plurality of Z-heights and the determined associative relationship. In some embodiments, the plurality of in-vehicle systems may be controlled concurrently to direct a plurality of output from the plurality of in-vehicle systems to corresponding body portions of each of the one or more occupants in thevehicle102.For example, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to control an angle of one or more vents of the HVAC system to direct an airflow toward a first body portion, such as the entire face portion, of the first occupant. The airflow may be directed toward the first body portion, such as the entire face portion, based on the estimated first Z-height (e.g., “X” cm) of the first body portion (i.e., the face portion) of the first occupant and the determined associative relationship that the first Z-height is associated with the HVAC system of thevehicle102. The one or more vents of the HVAC system may correspond to vents that are controlled by one or more servo motors. The one or more servo motors may be coupled to the one or more vents of the HVAC system. The in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to communicate a position control signal to the one or more servo-controlled vents to automatically control positioning and/or angle of the one or more servo-controlled vents in real time or near-real time. Thus, the positioning and/or angle of the one or more servo-controlled vents may be controlled in real time or near-real time in accordance to the estimated Z-height of the first body portion (e.g., the face portion) of the first occupant (e.g., thefirst user116A).In accordance with an embodiment, the image-capture device112may be configured to continuously or intermittently track a plurality of different spatial locations (in X, Y, and Z coordinates) of each face portion of the one or more occupants of thevehicle102. In cases where a change in a spatial location is detected for one face portion or a plurality of face potions, the positioning and/or angle of the one or more servo-controlled vents may be updated in real time or near-real time to target the airflow to the changed spatial location of each face portion.In another embodiment, instead of an image-capture device, a thermal sensor or imager may be used to determine portions of an individual that are hot. In cases where localized hot spots are detected, the positioning and/or angle of the one or more servo-controlled vents may be updated in real time or near-real time to target the airflow to the changed spatial location of each localized hot spot. When multiple hot spots are detected, the positioning and/or angle of the one or more servo-controlled vents may focus on one hot spot until it falls below a threshold level. Alternately, the positioning and/or angle of the one or more servo-controlled vents may cycle through multiple of the hot spots, or the angle of the vents may be widened.In another example, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to control the vehicle audio system to direct an audio output from a plurality of audio speakers of the vehicle audio system to a second body portion of the first occupant. In this case, the second body portion may refer to the middle portion of the face rectangle of the detected facial portion of the first occupant (such as thefirst user116A). The audio output from the plurality of audio speakers may be directed toward the second body portion based on the estimated second Z-height (e.g., “Y” cm) of the second body portion (e.g., the middle portion of the face rectangle) of the first occupant and the determined associative relationship that the second Z-height is associated with the vehicle audio system. Thus, similar to the first occupant, different Z-heights are estimated for each occupant from the middle portion of the face rectangle to the reference position, and the vehicle audio system may be tuned in real time or near-real time for optimum audio performance and enhanced listening experience for the one or more occupants in thevehicle102.In accordance with an embodiment, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to monitor, by use of the image-capture device112, a plurality of defined metrics related to the driver, such as thefirst user116A, of thevehicle102. The plurality of defined metrics related to the driver of thevehicle102may include, but are not limited to a facial position, body language, a seating position, eye movement, body movement, health parameters, and a tone, or pitch of driver's voice. The in-vehicleelectronic device114may detect a state of the driver of thevehicle102based on the analysis of the plurality of defined metrics. The in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to utilize a machine learning system to detect if the driver is in normal state or in a distressed state when a sudden deviation in the plurality of defined metrics is detected. For example, based on historical data related to driver (such as the identifiedfirst user116A), a baseline behavior, body language, seating position, eye movement, body movement, health parameters, and the tone, or pitch of driver's voice may be established as regular and tagged as normal. Thus, when a sudden deviation or anomaly in the plurality of defined metrics is detected, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may generate and communicate a driver emergency alert signal to the vehicle audio system for output. The vehicle audio system may be activated and an audio alert, (e.g., “Are you OK, or shall I alert emergency services?”) may be outputted via one of the plurality of speakers of the vehicle audio system. This may occur when the driver is suspected to be in distressed state. Thereafter, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to activate an emergency response (ERS) mode in thevehicle102. The in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to communicate a health emergency alert signal to themedical emergency center106if no response is received from the driver within a user specified or pre-defined time period. The health emergency alert signal may be referred to as emergency call systems, or simply eCall. eCall is an emergency response system known in the art. Typically, when vehicle crash sensors are triggered, the eCall system detects that the occupants are in distress and automatically calls emergency services to alert of possible injuries. The eCall system also transmits vehicle location (e.g., GPS coordinates) to the medical emergency center106(e.g., an emergency response team).In accordance with an embodiment, when the ERS mode is activated and no response is received from the driver (e.g., thefirst user116A) within the user specified or pre-defined time period, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may be configured to communicate a self-diagnostic test start signal to an on-board diagnostics (OBD) system of thevehicle102. The self-diagnostic test is done to determine whether thevehicle102is damaged or okay-to-drive in an autonomous mode or auto pilot (AP) mode. In cases where thevehicle102is damaged, thevehicle102remains parked, a health emergency alert signal is communicated to themedical emergency center106. In cases where thevehicle102is diagnosed as okay-to-drive but the driver is unresponsive to the audio alert, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may communicate an autonomous mode start signal to an engine control module (ECM) of thevehicle102. This may cause thevehicle102to automatically drive itself to a nearest hospital or an emergency service provider, such as themedical emergency center106. In certain scenarios, the driver profile may include user preferences related to handling of emergency response. For example, the driver, such as thefirst user116A may feed information related to one or more hospitals of choice in an order of preference, a preferred health insurance network, contact numbers of friends and family, and the like, via a user interface rendered on the display (such as thedisplay210ofFIG.2). In cases where such user preferences related to handling of emergency response is present, and the emergency response AP-mode is activated, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may dynamically set a destination location in a navigation unit of thevehicle102to one of the preferred hospitals. The selection of the preferred hospital from the listed hospitals may be done based on a shortest distance between each location of the listed hospitals from a current location of thevehicle102and the order of preference. Thereafter, the in-vehicleelectronic device114may communicate the autonomous mode start signal to the ECM of thevehicle102to cause thevehicle102to automatically drive itself to the set destination location of the selected hospital. The in-vehicleelectronic device114may also communicate a route information from the current location of thevehicle102to the set destination location of the selected hospital, to the contact numbers of friends and family, as provided in the driver profile. The route information may be communicated via thewireless communication network110, by use of a wireless communication system of thevehicle102.FIG.2is a block diagram that illustrates various exemplary components or systems of a vehicle, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.FIG.2is explained in conjunction with elements fromFIG.1.

In some embodiments, the plurality of in-vehicle systems216may be controlled concurrently to direct a plurality of output from the plurality of in-vehicle systems216such that output from one in-vehicle system, such as theHVAC system226, do not interfere (and instead complement) with output of another in-vehicle system, such as thevehicle audio system228, of the plurality of in-vehicle systems216.Thecircuitry202, such as the microprocessor, may be configured to control an angle of the first set ofvents324A of theHVAC unit324to direct an airflow (such as thefirst airflow326A) toward the firstfacial portion312A of thefirst occupant310A. The airflow (such as thefirst airflow326A) may be directed toward the firstfacial portion312A based on the estimated first Z-height320A (e.g., “XI” cm) and the determined associative relationship that the first Z-height320A (e.g., “XI” cm) is meant for theHVAC system226of thevehicle102. Thecircuitry202may be configured to communicate a position control signal to the first set ofvents324A to automatically control positioning and/or angle of first set ofvents324A such that an airflow output from the first set ofvents324A is directed toward the firstfacial portion312A. Similarly, thecircuitry202may be configured to control an angle of the second set ofvents324B of theHVAC unit324to direct an airflow (such as thesecond airflow326B) toward the secondfacial portion312B of thesecond occupant310B in accordance with the estimated third Z-height320B (also represented by “X2” cm”). The positioning and/or angle of the servo-motor230controlled first set ofvents324A and the second set ofvents324B are vertically adjusted and updated continuously to control airflow in real time or near-real time based on face tracking and change in estimation of corresponding Z-heights of thefacial portions312A and312B.The control the plurality of in-vehicle systems216further includes control of thevehicle audio system228to direct an audio output from the plurality ofspeakers232of thevehicle audio system228toward the midfacial portions318A and318B offirst occupant310A and thesecond occupant310B respectively. The directivity of the audio output may be based on the second Z-height322A (also represented by “Y1” cm”) and the fourth Z-height322B (also represented by “Y2” cm”) and the determined associative relationship that the “YI” and “Y2” are associated with thevehicle audio system228for optimum audio experience. Thus, thevehicle audio system228may be tuned in real time or near-real time for optimum audio performance and enhanced listening experience for thefirst occupant310A and thesecond occupant310B in thevehicle102.With reference toFIG.3E, there is shown anexemplary scenario300E.FIG.3Eis explained in conjunction with elements fromFIGS.1,2, and3A to3D. Theexemplary scenario300E illustrates a top view of the interior of thevehicle102to depict a precise and a real time personalization of in-vehicle systems based on Z-heights of body portions of vehicle occupants, occupants positioning, and the number of occupants. There is further shown a first center ofaudio focus330A, a second center ofaudio focus330B and different directions ofairflows332A,332B,332C, and332D based on positioning and the detected number of occupants, such as thefirst occupant310A, thesecond occupant310B, athird occupant310C, and afourth occupant310D.In accordance with an embodiment, in addition to the vertical Z-height based personalization, a horizontal (X, Y coordinates) occupant's position based personalization may also occur in thevehicle102. For example, thecircuitry202may be configured to determine and update an optimal location in real time or near-real time for a center of audio focus in the interior of thevehicle102based on a track of current positioning of one or more occupants in thevehicle102. For example, when a single occupant, such as thefirst occupant310A is present in thevehicle102, thecircuitry202may communicate a first control signal to thevehicle audio system228to focus the output from the plurality ofspeakers232to the first center ofaudio focus330A. Thecircuitry202may also communicate a second control signal to theHVAC system226to selectively direct theairflow332A from a front HVAC unit of theHVAC system226to the firstfacial portion312A of thefirst occupant310A. In some embodiments, both the first control signal and the second control signal may be communicated concurrently to respective in-vehicle systems.In accordance with an embodiment, when the number of occupants or seating position of the occupants changes (an increase in this case) in thevehicle102, thecircuitry202may be configured to shift the first center ofaudio focus330A to the second center ofaudio focus330B, as shown inFIG.3E. In some embodiments, a combination of seat occupancy sensors (such as theseat occupancy sensor224A) and the face tracking feature of the image-capture device112may be utilized for an accurate occupant(s) position estimation.Further, the output from different servo-controlled vents in the front or rear of thevehicle102may be controlled such that each of thefirst occupant310A, thesecond occupant310B, thethird occupant310C, and thefourth occupant310D receive a personalized directed airflow (e.g., the different directions ofairflows332A,332B,332C, and332D, as shown). The personalized directed airflow towards their facial portions may be outputted in accordance to estimated Z-heights of the facial portions, as discussed inFIGS.3C and3D, for example.In accordance with an embodiment, Right-left (R-L) balance, Front-back (F-B) fade, and other audio settings may be adjusted for optimal listening experience for current positioning of the one or more occupants. Further, when thevehicle102stops and one passenger exits thevehicle102, the image-capture device112may be configured to detect change in an occupant seating scenario. Thecircuitry202, based on the detected change in the occupant seating scenario, may automatically update audio settings of thevehicle audio system228for the remaining occupants (i.e. new occupant seating scenario).With reference toFIG.3F, there is shown anexemplary scenario300F.FIG.3Fis explained in conjunction with elements fromFIGS.1,2, and3A to3E. Theexemplary scenario300F illustrates a portion of the interior of thevehicle102to depict monitoring of a driver state. There is shown thefirst occupant310A in a distressed state in thevehicle102.In accordance with an embodiment, thecircuitry202may be configured to monitor, by use of the image-capture device112, a plurality of defined metrics related to the driver, such as thefirst occupant310A, of thevehicle102. The plurality of defined metrics related to the driver of thevehicle102may include, but are not limited to a facial position, body language, a seating position, eye movement, body movement, health parameters, and a tone, or pitch of driver's voice. In accordance to theexemplary scenario300F, the driver, such as thefirst occupant310A, is detected in a distressed state during after a crash. Thecircuitry202activates an emergency response (ERS) mode in thevehicle102and seeks response from the driver (e.g., thefirst occupant310A) within the user specified or pre-defined time period. In other embodiments, a driver dozing off is identified through recognition of closing eyes or a bobbing head. In such a situation, an alert may be sounded, cabin temperature may be reduced, cold air may be blown on the driver, and thevehicle102may be brought to a stop in a safe manner, or another action may be taken.Thereafter, thecircuitry202may be configured to communicate a self-diagnostic test start signal to an on-board diagnostics (OBD) system of thevehicle102. The self-diagnostic test is done to determine whether thevehicle102is damaged or okay-to-drive in an autonomous mode or auto pilot (AP) mode. In cases where thevehicle102is damaged, thevehicle102remains parked, and a health emergency alert signal is communicated to themedical emergency center106, by thewireless communication system238. In cases where thevehicle102is diagnosed as okay-to-drive but thefirst occupant310A is unresponsive, thecircuitry202may communicate an autonomous mode start signal to an engine control module (ECM) of thevehicle102. This may cause thevehicle102to automatically drive itself to a preferred hospital based on the identified driver profile “DOI”.FIGS.4A,4B,4C, and4Dcollectively, depict a flow chart that illustrates exemplary operations for personalization of a vehicle based on spatial locations of body portions of occupants in the vehicle, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. With reference toFIGS.4A,4B,4C, and4Dthere is shown aflow chart400. Theflow chart400is described in conjunction withFIGS.1,2, and3A to3F. The operations, implemented at the in-vehicleelectronic device114in association with the image-capture device112, for personalization of a vehicle, begin at402and proceed to404.At404, a plurality of images or a video of one or more occupants in thevehicle102may be captured. The image-capture device112may be configured to capture the plurality of images or the video of the one or more occupants in thevehicle102. At406, facial portion(s) of one or more occupants in thevehicle102may be detected based on the plurality of images or the video captured by the image-capture device112.At408, at least a driver profile or a passenger profile (each could also be referred to as an occupant profile) associated with each occupant (who may be seated at a driver seat or one of the passenger seats) may be searched based on a comparison of facial features of the occupant with stored facial features of users related to a plurality of driver profiles and a plurality of passenger profiles. Thecircuitry202, such as a microprocessor, may be configured to search for the driver profile and/or the passenger profile of each occupant based on the comparison of the facial features of the occupant, such as thefirst occupant310A, with stored facial features of users related to the plurality of driver profiles stored in thememory204. At410, facial recognition is performed on the acquired data, such as the plurality of images or the video of the one or more occupants, to identify a driver profile and/or a passenger profile. Thecircuitry202may be configured to check whether the driver profile is identified based on facial recognition from the stored plurality of driver profiles in thememory204. Similarly, thecircuitry202may be further configured to check whether the passenger profile is identified based on facial recognition from the stored plurality of passenger profiles in thememory204. A match of the facial features of an occupant, such as thefirst occupant310A, with stored facial features of one user may result in the facial recognition. In cases where the driver profile and/or the passenger profile is identified, the control passes to412else to416.At412, an audio signal may be communicated to thevehicle audio system228to output customized audio greeting to at least thefirst occupant310A. Thecircuitry202may be configured to communicate the audio signal to thevehicle audio system228to output the customized audio greeting, for example, “Hello, Fredrick” to thefirst occupant310A. At414, a first level of customization may be executed in thevehicle102based on defined user-preferences in the identified driver profile or passenger profile of the one or more occupants, such as thefirst occupant310A. For example, the electrically powered adjustable components, such as the driver seat, vehicle mirrors (e.g., the ORVM208), front mirror, radio, music preferences, and driving mode preferences, may be adjusted in accordance with the user preferences in the driver profile of thefirst user116A. Thecircuitry202may be configured to communicate a plurality of control signals to one or more other ECUs to initiate the adjustments in accordance with the user preferences in the driver profile of thefirst occupant310A. In some embodiments, if there are more than one occupants in thevehicle102, similar to thefirst occupant310A, audio signal may be communicated to thevehicle audio system228to output customized audio greeting to each occupant. For example, in addition to custom audio greeting to thefirst occupant310A, thesecond occupant310B may also be greeted as, “Hello Samantha, how are you doing today?”, via an audio speaker that is in vicinity of thesecond occupant310B.At416, an unrecognized occupant (e.g., a first occupant, a second occupant, or a new occupant) may be marked (or tagged) as a new user and a request to set a new profile may be generated on thedisplay210of an infotainment head unit (e.g., the in-vehicle electronic device114). In cases where there are multiple occupants, and one or more occupants are not identified, for example, a passenger seated at the front seat, the passenger may be tagged as new user and requested to set the new profile similar to thefirst occupant310A, such as the driver. At418, a plurality of Z-heights of a plurality of body portions of each of the one or more occupants in thevehicle102may be estimated. An example of the estimation of the plurality of Z-heights, has been shown and described in details in theFIG.3C.At420, an associative relationship may be determined between the estimated plurality of Z-heights of the plurality of body portions of each of the one or more occupants and the plurality of in-vehicle systems216of thevehicle102. An example of the associative relationship is depicted in TABLE 1 in theFIG.3C. At422, the plurality of in-vehicle systems216may be controlled to direct an output from a corresponding in-vehicle system of the plurality of in-vehicle systems216to a specific body portion of the plurality of body portions of each of the one or more occupants in thevehicle102. An example of the control of the plurality of in-vehicle systems216, such as theHVAC system226and thevehicle audio system228, has been shown and described in theFIGS.3D and3E.At424, an optimal location to direct the audio in the interior of thevehicle102is determined, based on positioning of the one or more occupants in thevehicle102. An example of the determination of the optimal location for the center of audio (or music) focus has been shown and described inFIG.3E. In some embodiments, as thevehicle102includes the plurality ofspeakers232, audio from all of the plurality ofspeakers232may be directed towards one location (or position). Alternatively, a same audio or different audio from the plurality ofspeakers232may be directed toward different locations in the interior of thevehicle102based on positioning of the one or more occupants in thevehicle102. In cases where audio output from the plurality ofspeakers232are directed toward different locations, each speaker or a group of speakers of the plurality ofspeakers232may output different audio to different locations suited to individual occupant in thevehicle102. Audio beam forming techniques may be used for providing directed audio toward each occupant. For example, certain speakers of the plurality ofspeakers232may be in close proximity to an occupant. For instance, the vehicle door near driver may comprise multiple speakers to allow for beam forming. In some scenarios, the selection of different audio may be based on individual user-preferences in accordance with identified driver and passenger profiles of each occupant.At426, an angle of the one or more vents of theHVAC system226may be controlled to direct an airflow toward a first body portion, such as the firstfacial portion312A, of thefirst occupant310A of the one or more occupants. The airflow may be directed toward the first body portion based on a first Z-height (e.g., the first Z-height320A) of the first body portion of thefirst occupant310A in the determined associative relationship. An example of control of angle to direct an airflow toward a specific body portion, has been shown and described inFIGS.3D and3E.At428, thevehicle audio system228may be controlled to direct an audio output from the plurality ofspeakers232of thevehicle audio system228to a second body portion of plurality of body portions of thefirst occupant310A. The audio output, for example, an audio beam, may be directed based on a second Z-height (e.g., the second Z-height322A) of the second body portion of thefirst occupant310A in the determined associative relationship. An example of the control ofvehicle audio system228angle to direct an audio output toward a specific body portion, has been shown and described in theFIG.3D. At430, a change in occupant(s) seating positions and a number of current occupants in thevehicle102may be detected. Thecircuitry202may be configured to detect the change in occupant(s) seating positions and the number of current occupants in thevehicle102based on face tracking of the one or more occupants. In some embodiments, a combination of seat occupancy sensors (such as theseat occupancy sensor224A) and the face tracking feature of the image-capture device112may be utilized for an accurate occupant(s) position estimation. In some embodiments, where there are multiple occupants, for example, the driver, a front passenger and a back passenger seated in a rear seat, the front passenger might have similar setting for air flow, audio, and the like, as that of the driver. However, the back passenger seated in the rear seat, may be a child (or a user of different age-group) and may be associated with different settings (e.g. a preference of reduced audio level as compared to front occupants, a different choice for audio, airflow settings, and the like). Accordingly, different audio may be played for the back passenger based on identified passenger profile for the rear seat passenger, or a specific audio may be directed to ears of the passenger (e.g., the child) based on the estimated Z-height. In some embodiments, settings for air flow, audio, and the like, may be specific for each occupant, such as the driver and each passenger, based on estimated Z-heights and user-preferences in their respective profiles (e.g., the identified passenger and driver profiles).At432, an optimal location for a center of audio focus and an angle of the one or more vents of the HVAC system may be dynamically updated. The update may be done for a specific body portion for new occupants. An example of the shift in the center of audio focus based on an increase in the number of occupants and a concurrent update in the angle of the one or more vents, has been described inFIG.3E. At434, a plurality of defined metrics related to a driver, such as thefirst occupant310A, ofvehicle102, may be monitored. An example of the monitoring of the plurality of defined metrics has been described inFIGS.1and3F.At436, a state of the driver of thevehicle102may be detected, based on an analysis of the plurality of defined metrics. An example of a distressed state is shown and described inFIG.3F. At438, it may be checked whether the driver is in normal state. In cases where the driver is detected in the normal state, the control returns to434, as shown. In cases where the driver is detected in the distressed state, the control passes to440.At440, a driver emergency alert signal may be generated and then communicated to thevehicle audio system228for output, such as an audio alert. Thecircuitry202may be configured to generate and then communicate the driver emergency alert signal to thevehicle audio system228for output via one of the plurality ofspeakers232. At442, it may be checked whether the driver is responsive to the generated output, such as the generated audio alert. In cases where the driver is responsive, the control may pass to444. In cases where the driver is unresponsive to the audio alert, the control may pass to446.At444, it may be determined whether the driver have requested for emergency services, such as to call themedical emergency center106. In cases where the driver has requested for emergency services, the control may pass to446, else the control may return to434. At446, an emergency response (ERS) mode may be activated in thevehicle102. Thecircuitry202may be configured to activate the ERS mode in thevehicle102.At448, a health emergency alert signal may be communicated to themedical emergency center106. Thecircuitry202may be configured to communicate the health emergency alert signal to themedical emergency center106if no response is received from the driver (e.g., thefirst occupant310A) within a user specified or pre-defined time period. The health emergency alert signal may be referred to as emergency call systems, or simply eCall. At450, it may be checked whether thevehicle102is damaged based on a self-diagnostic test of thevehicle102. In cases where the vehicle is damaged, the control may pass to448to call for emergency services. In cases where the vehicle is not damaged and diagnosed as okay-to-drive, the control may pass to452.At452, an autonomous mode start signal may be communicated to the engine control module of thevehicle102. In cases where thevehicle102is diagnosed as okay-to-drive but the driver is unresponsive to the audio alert, thecircuitry202may communicate the autonomous mode start signal to the ECM. At454, thevehicle102may be automatically driven to themedical emergency center106. The control may pass to the end. The receipt of the autonomous mode start signal at the ECM may cause thevehicle102to automatically drive itself to a nearest hospital, such as themedical emergency center106or a preferred hospital, if provided in the identified driver profile.The present disclosure may be realized in hardware, or a combination of hardware and software.

       "  'description': 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe subject matter described herein relates generally to controlling operation of a wind turbine, and more specifically, to controlling operation of a wind turbine based at least partially on upwind measurements from an upwind measurement device.Wind turbine generators utilize wind energy to produce electrical power. Wind turbine generators typically include a rotor having multiple blades that transform wind energy into rotational motion of a drive shaft, which in turn is utilized to drive an electrical generator to produce electrical power. Each of the multiple blades may be pitched to increase or decrease the rotational speed of the rotor. Pitching a blade refers to rotating the blade to change the angle of attack of the wind on the blade. Pitching toward feather, or feathering the pitch, refers to rotating the blade such that the blade surface is aligned along a direction of the wind speed (i.e., reducing the angle of attack). Pitching a blade toward feather decreases wind energy capture by the blade. Typically, blades are progressively pitched toward feather to counteract increasing wind speed in order to maintain a substantially constant generator speed.Changes in atmospheric conditions, for example, wind speed, wind turbulence intensity, and wind direction, may significantly influence power produced by wind turbine generators. A power output of a wind turbine generator increases with wind speed until the wind speed reaches a rated wind speed for the turbine. At and above the rated wind speed, the wind turbine generator operates at a rated power. The rated power is an output power at which a wind turbine generator can operate with a level of fatigue to turbine components that is predetermined to be acceptable. At wind speeds higher than a certain speed, or at a wind turbulence level that exceeds a predetermined magnitude, typically referred to as a “trip limit” or “monitor set point limit,” wind turbines may be shut down, or the loads may be reduced by regulating the pitch of the blades or braking the rotor, in order to protect wind turbine components against damage. A static rated power and static trip limits are typically determined during a design stage of the wind turbine and therefore are not dependent upon changing wind conditions that may be present during operation of the wind turbine. A high wind turbulence intensity corresponds to frequently changing wind conditions, which may include frequent and/or strong wind gusts. Wind gusts are sudden, brief increases in the speed of the wind.Sensors positioned on the wind turbine react to wind conditions as they affect the wind turbine. For example, a wind speed sensor positioned on the wind turbine will measure a wind gust at substantially the same time as the wind gust strikes the rotor blades. Wind turbine operation adjustments are subject to a time lag between measurement of the wind gust and the actual pitching of the blades, and therefore, wind turbine operation adjustments typically are performed at a time after the wind gust has affected wind turbine operation. As a result, the wind gust may cause the rotor speed and/or the output power to exceed a trip limit, before a wind turbine operation adjustment is completed, causing a wind turbine shut down.Measurements of wind conditions upwind from the wind turbine may be used by a system controller of the wind turbine to determine wind turbine operating commands. A change in wind speed may be measured upwind from the wind turbine, and the pitch of the blades adjusted to compensate for the change in wind speed once the wind reaches the wind turbine. However, wind turbine performance may be reduced in times of high wind turbulence due to oscillations in blade pitch caused by rapid component adjustments. Additionally, a balance between a torque on the rotor created by interaction of the rotor blades and the wind and a generator torque facilitates stable operation of the wind turbine. Blade pitch adjustments may cause an imbalance between the torque on the rotor caused by the wind and the generator torque.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONIn one aspect, a method for controlling operation of a wind turbine is provided.

Although only onewind turbine10is shown inFIG. 1, in some embodiments, a plurality ofwind turbines10may be grouped together, sometimes referred to as a “wind farm.”Wind turbine10includes a body ornacelle12and a rotor (generally designated by14) coupled tobody12for rotation with respect tobody12about an axis ofrotation20. In the exemplary embodiment,body12is mounted on atower16.

Of course, in any of the embodiments,rotor14may not face exactly upwind and/or downwind, but may face generally at any angle (which may be variable) with respect to a direction of the wind to harness energy therefrom.Referring now toFIG. 2,wind turbine10includes anelectrical generator26coupled torotor14for generating electrical power from the rotational energy generated byrotor14.Generator26may be any suitable type of electrical generator, such as, but not limited to, a wound rotor induction generator.Generator26includes a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not shown).Rotor14includes arotor shaft28coupled torotor hub22for rotation therewith.Generator26is coupled torotor shaft28such that rotation ofrotor shaft28drives rotation of the generator rotor, and therefore operation ofgenerator26. In the exemplary embodiment, agenerator shaft30is coupled to the generator rotor and coupled torotor shaft28such that rotation ofrotor shaft28drives rotation of the generator rotor. In other embodiments, the generator rotor is directly coupled torotor shaft28, sometimes referred to as a “direct-drive wind turbine.” In the exemplary embodiment,generator shaft30is coupled torotor shaft28through agearbox32, although in otherembodiments generator shaft30is coupled directly torotor shaft28.The torque ofrotor14drives the generator rotor to thereby generate variable frequency alternating current (AC) electrical power from rotation ofrotor14.Generator26has an air gap torque between the generator rotor and stator that opposes the torque ofrotor14. Afrequency converter34is coupled togenerator26for converting the variable frequency AC to a fixed frequency AC for delivery to an electrical load (not shown), such as, but not limited to a power grid (not shown), coupled togenerator26.Frequency converter34also controls the air gap torque which facilitates controlling the power output ofgenerator26.Frequency converter34may be located anywhere within or remote towind turbine10. For example,frequency converter34may be located within a base (not shown) oftower16.In some embodiments,wind turbine10may include a rotor speed limiter, for example, but not limited to adisk brake36.Disk brake36brakes rotation ofrotor14to, for example, slow rotation ofrotor14,brake rotor14against full wind torque, and/or reduce the generation of electrical power fromelectrical generator26. Furthermore, in some embodiments,wind turbine10may include ayaw system38for rotatingbody12about an axis ofrotation40for changing a yaw ofrotor14, and more specifically for changing a direction faced byrotor14to, for example, adjust an angle between the direction faced byrotor14and a direction of wind.In an exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10includes a variableblade pitch system42for controlling, including but not limited to changing, a pitch angle ofrotor blades24with respect to a wind direction.Pitch system42may be coupled to asystem controller44for control thereby.Pitch system42is coupled tohub22andblades24, and includes pitch actuators for changing the pitch angle ofblades24by rotatingblades24with respect tohub22.

In the exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10includes one ormore system controllers44coupled to some or all of the components ofwind turbine10for generally controlling operation ofwind turbine10and/or controlling operation of some or all of the components thereof, regardless of whether such components are described and/or illustrated herein. For example, in the exemplary embodiment,system controller44is coupled to variableblade pitch system42for controlling the pitch ofblades24. Furthermore,system controller44is coupled to, and configured to control,frequency converter34. In the exemplary embodiment,system controller44is mounted within body12(shown inFIG. 2). However, additionally or alternatively, one ormore system controllers44may be remote frombody12and/or other components ofwind turbine10.System controller44may be used for, but is not limited to, overall system monitoring and control including, for example, pitch and speed regulation, high-speed shaft and yaw brake application, yaw and pump motor application, and/or fault monitoring. Alternative distributed or centralized control architectures may be used in some embodiments.In an exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10includes a plurality of sensors, for example,sensors50,52,54,56, and58.Sensors50,52,54,56, and58measure a variety of parameters, including, but not limited to, operating conditions and atmospheric conditions. Each ofsensors50,52,54,56, and58may be an individual sensor or a plurality of sensors.Sensors50,52,54,56, and58may be any suitable sensor having any suitable location within or remote towind turbine10that allowswind turbine10to function as described herein. In some embodiments,sensors50,52,54,58, and58are coupled tosystem controller44for transmitting measurements tosystem controller44for processing thereof.In the exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10also includes an upwind windcondition measurement device60. In the exemplary embodiment, upwind windcondition measurement device60is configured to measure at least one wind condition upwind fromwind turbine10and provide the measurement tosystem controller44.System controller44is configured to control a rotor speed and an electrical power output ofgenerator26based at least partially on the upwind wind condition measurement. Rotor speed and power output ofelectrical generator26may be controlled by controlling the pitch ofblades24using variableblade pitch system42. Controlling air gap torque ofgenerator26through use offrequency converter34may also simultaneously control power output ofgenerator26and an overall mechanical load togenerator26.In some embodiments,system controller44includes abus62or other communications device to communicate information. In at least one specific example,system controller44includes a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. One or more processor(s)64may be coupled tobus62to process information, including information fromsensors50,52,54,56,58and/or other sensor(s), as well as information from upwind windcondition measurement device60.System controller44may also include one or more random access memories (RAM)66and/or other storage device(s)68. RAM(s)66and storage device(s)68are coupled tobus62to store and transfer information and instructions to be executed by processor(s)64. RAM(s)66(and/or also storage device(s)68, if included) can also be used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor(s)64.System controller44may also include one or more read only memories (ROM)70and/or other static storage devices coupled tobus62to store and provide static (i.e., non-changing) information and instructions to processor(s)64.Processor64may include any programmable system including systems and microcontrollers, reduced instruction set circuits (RISC), application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), programmable logic circuits (PLC), and any other circuit or processor capable of executing the functions described herein. The above examples are exemplary only, and thus are not intended to limit in any way the definition and/or meaning of the term processor.System controller44may also include, or may be coupled to, input/output device(s)72. Input/output device(s)72may include any device known in the art to provide input data tosystem controller44and/or to provide outputs, such as, but not limited to, yaw control, pitch control, and/or generator torque outputs. Instructions may be provided tomemory66fromstorage device68, such as, but not limited to, a magnetic disk, a read-only memory (ROM) integrated circuit, CD-ROM, and/or DVD, via a remote connection that is either wired or wireless providing access to one or more electronically-accessible media, etc. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry can be used in place of or in combination with software instructions. Thus, execution of sequences of instructions is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software instructions, whether described and/or illustrated herein.System controller44may also include asensor interface74that allowssystem controller44to communicate withsensors50,52,54,56,58and/or other sensor(s), as well as to communicate with upwind windcondition measurement device60.Sensor interface74may include one or more analog-to-digital converters that convert analog signals into digital signals that can be used by processor(s)64.FIG. 4is another perspective view of wind turbine10(shown inFIG. 1), further illustrating upwind wind condition measurement device60(shown inFIG. 3). As described above, in cases of sudden wind gusts, wind speed may increase in a relatively small interval of time. In the exemplary embodiment, wind turbine components are preemptively adjusted before a gust hits rotor14(shown inFIG. 1) in order to compensate for a time lag between measurement of the wind gust and a response by wind turbine components. For example, in order to compensate for the time lag between measurement of the wind gust and response of variableblade pitch system42,blades24are preemptively pitched before the gust hitsrotor14. In a specific example, variableblade pitch system42can change the blade pitch to fully feathered in ten seconds. At a given wind speed, if upwind windcondition measurement device60measures a wind gust a distance of three hundred meters upwind fromrotor14, the blades can be fully feathered by the time the wind gust reachesrotor14.Preemptively pitchingblades24prior to interaction with the wind gust facilitates preventing the wind gust from applying a high load torotor14. Furthermore, in the exemplary embodiment, operation offrequency converter34is preemptively adjusted to balance the torque applied torotor14by the wind and the torque ongenerator26. For example, both the pitch ofblades24and the torque ongenerator26are adjusted upon measurement of a changed wind condition measured a distance upwind fromrotor14.Adjusting the blade pitch in anticipation of the wind gust facilitates runningwind turbine10through the wind gust. Adjusting the blade pitch also facilitates maintaining a substantially constant rotor speed and power output fromwind turbine10during such sudden gusts, or at least a relatively smooth or controlled transient in rotor speed and power output. Measuring the wind condition in advance of the wind condition interacting withrotor14, and shedding the incoming load in advance by controlling the blade pitch and generator torque, facilitates preventing generator26(shown inFIG. 3) from reaching a trip limit upon thegust reaching rotor14. More specifically, shedding the incoming load in advance facilitates preventing, for example, but not limited to, reaching an overspeed trip limit, a power trip limit, and/or a turbine oscillation magnitude/load limit upon thegust reaching rotor14. The methods and system described herein facilitateoperating wind turbine10through the wind gust, rather than having to shut downwind turbine10.To implement this preemptive pitching, at least one wind condition is sensed upwind ofblades24by upwind windcondition measurement device60. The at least one wind condition may include a wind speed, a wind direction, and/or a wind turbulence intensity. Although described herein as measuring wind turbulence intensity, upwind windcondition measurement device60and/orsystem controller44may be configured to determine the wind turbine intensity by measuring wind speed and calculating a variance in wind speed around an average measured wind speed. In the exemplary embodiment, upwind windcondition measurement device60is a light detection and ranging device, also referred to as LIDAR. However, upwind windcondition measurement device60may also include any suitable measurement device that allowssystem controller44to function as described herein.LIDAR60is a measurement device configured to scan an annular region aroundwind turbine10and measure upwind wind conditions based upon reflection and/or back-scattering of light transmitted byLIDAR60from aerosol. The cone angle (θ) and the range (R) ofLIDAR60may be suitably selected to provide a desired accuracy of measurement as well as an acceptable sensitivity. In the illustrated embodiment,LIDAR60is located onhub22whereuponblades24are mounted. In certain alternate embodiments,LIDAR60may also be located around the base of thewind turbine tower16.In the exemplary embodiment,LIDAR60is configured to measure an upwind wind condition ahead of at least one specific portion, typically the most significant sections ofblades24in terms of contributions of those sections to aerodynamic torque on the blades. These sections may include, for example, sections close to the tips ofblades24. The points ahead ofblades24at which wind conditions are measured byLIDAR60are represented by aplane76.FIG. 5is a control diagram100that illustrates a flow of exemplary control signals during operation of a wind turbine, for example, operation of wind turbine10(shown inFIGS. 1-4). As described above,wind turbine10includes a rotor having a plurality of rotor blades, for example,rotor14having rotor blades24(shown inFIG. 1), and an upwind wind condition measurement device, for example, upwind wind condition measurement device60(shown inFIGS. 3-4). As described above, in the exemplary embodiment, upwind windcondition measurement device60is a LIDAR device configured to generate and output a LIDAR signal that corresponds to at least one of a measuredupwind wind speed120, a measuredupwind wind direction122, and a measured upwindwind turbulence intensity124.In the exemplary embodiment,upwind wind speed120,upwind wind direction122, and upwindwind turbulence intensity124are received at a system controller, for example, system controller44(shown inFIG. 3).System controller44determines acontrol algorithm parameter130based at least partially on the measured upwindwind turbulence intensity124.System controller44may also determine a wind turbine setpoint132, for example, a power set point and/or a rotor speed set point, based at least partially onupwind wind speed120andupwind wind direction122. Sensors, for example, sensor54(shown inFIG. 3) measure actual positions and/or settings of wind turbine components and actual performance of the wind turbine components, andoutput sensor readings134.Control algorithm parameter130, wind turbine setpoint132, andsensor readings134are entered into a control algorithm.System controller44is also configured to generate at least one of a windturbine operating command136based on an output of the control algorithm and apply the windturbine operating command136to adjustable components and/or systems ofwind turbine10, for example, variableblade pitch system42andfrequency converter34. The windturbine operating command136may facilitate setting a blade pitch control target and/or a blade pitch change curve that controls the pitch of the blades as they are adjusted toward the blade pitch control target. The windturbine operating command136may also facilitate setting a generator torque control target and/or a generator torque change curve that controls the generator torque as it is adjusted toward the generator torque control target.In an exemplary embodiment,control algorithm parameter130is a gain or a set of gains, for example, a proportional gain and/or an integration gain, that is applied in the control algorithm. Furthermore,control algorithm parameter130may include a controller matrix/model for use by a control system using state-space control techniques and/or a multi-input/multi-output control system. In some examples, the control algorithm is stored in memory66(shown inFIG. 3) ofsystem controller44.System controller44uses the control algorithm to generate operating commands for adjustable components ofwind turbine10. In the exemplary embodiment, the operating commands are dependent upon inputs to the control algorithm, for example,control algorithm parameter130, wind turbine setpoint132, andsensor readings134. More specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, the control algorithm outputs operating commands to, for example, variableblade pitch system42and/orfrequency converter34. In the exemplary embodiment, the operating commands may include a response bandwidth signal and a response speed signal. The response bandwidth signal and the response speed signal control the speed at which the adjustable component reaches a target position. The response bandwidth signal is sent fromsystem controller44to, for example, upwind windcondition measurement device60, and configured to control a frequency at whichdevice60measures upwind wind conditions (e.g., control a resolution ofdevice60, and therefore, the ability ofdevice60to differentiate between wind conditions). The response speed signals is sent fromsystem controller44to, for example, variableblade pitch system42and/orfrequency converter34, and configured to control a speed at whichsystem42andconverter34respond to signals fromsystem controller44. The response bandwidth and response speed are inversely proportional to a response time. In other words, the response bandwidth and response speed determine a length of time for the adjustable component to move from a present position to the target position.The operating commands also include an error range signal, for example, a blade pitch error range signal and a generator torque error range signal. The error range signal controls the accuracy of adjustments to wind turbine components. For example, the blade pitch error range is a range surrounding a blade pitch control target and the generator torque error range is a range surrounding a generator torque control target. Greater accuracy (i.e., smaller error ranges) facilitate higher performance ofwind turbine10because wind turbine components are positioned closer to a desired position. However, smaller error ranges may also decrease wind turbine stability due to increases in wind turbine component oscillations back-and-forth with overshoots across, and out of, the error range bounds around the control target until settling at a position within the error range.FIG. 6is adecision tree150illustrating an exemplary process executed by a wind turbine controller, for example, system controller44(shown inFIG. 3). In the exemplary embodiment, control algorithm parameters that correspond to rated operation ofwind turbine10are stored, for example, in memory66(shown inFIG. 3). In the exemplary embodiment,system controller44is programmed to use the rated control algorithm parameters when wind speed and wind turbulence intensity are within stored ranges. In the exemplary embodiment,system controller44is programmed to compare160upwind wind turbulence intensity124(shown inFIG. 5) to a first stored wind turbulence intensity level. If the measured upwindwind turbulence intensity124is greater than the first stored wind turbulence intensity level,system controller44is configured to decrease162the rated control algorithm parameters. For example,system controller44may be configured to decrease the control algorithm gain. If the measured upwindwind turbulence intensity124is less than the first stored wind turbulence intensity level,system controller44is configured to compare164the measured upwindwind turbulence intensity124to a second stored wind turbulence intensity level, wherein the second wind turbulence intensity level is lower than the first wind turbulence intensity level. If the measured upwind wind turbulence intensity is less than the second stored wind turbulence intensity level,system controller44is configured to increase166the rated control algorithm parameters. For example,system controller44may be configured to increase the control algorithm gain. If the measured upwindwind turbulence intensity124is between the first stored wind turbulence intensity level and the second stored wind turbulence intensity level,system controller44is configured to not change168the control algorithm parameters.FIG. 7is adecision tree170illustrating an exemplary process executed by a wind turbine controller, for example, system controller44(shown inFIG. 3). In the exemplary embodiment, a rated power set point and a rotor speed set point that correspond to rated operation ofwind turbine10are stored, for example, in memory66(shown inFIG. 3). In the exemplary embodiment,system controller44is programmed to compare172a measuredupwind wind speed120and a stored wind speed that corresponds to rated operation ofwind turbine10. In the exemplary embodiment, if the measuredwind speed120is greater than the stored wind speed,system controller44is configured to decrease174at least one of the stored power set point and the stored rotor speed set point. If the measuredwind speed120is less than the stored wind speed,system controller44is configured to not change176the stored power set point or the stored rotor speed set point.FIG. 8is aflow chart200of anexemplary method210for controlling a wind turbine, for example, wind turbine10(shown inFIGS. 1-4). In an exemplary embodiment,method210is a computer-implemented method, for example, a computer-implemented method executed by processor64(shown inFIG. 3). In another exemplary embodiment, a computer program embodied on a computer-readable medium includes at least one code segment, that when executed by, for example,processor64, performsmethod210.As described above,wind turbine10includes a rotor having a plurality of rotor blades, for example,rotor14having rotor blades24(shown inFIG. 1), and an upwind wind condition measurement device, for example, upwind wind condition measurement device60(shown inFIGS. 3-4). In the exemplary embodiment,method210includes measuring220a wind condition upwind fromrotor14using upwind windcondition measurement device60. Upwind windcondition measurement device60measures220at least one of a wind speed of wind upwind fromrotor14, a wind direction of wind upwind fromrotor14, and a wind turbulence intensity of wind upwind fromrotor14.Method210also includes providing222the measured wind condition to a processor, for example,processor64.In the exemplary embodiment,method210also includes determining224a control algorithm parameter, based at least partially on the measured wind condition, that controls at least one of a response bandwidth, a response speed, a control error range of a system and/or a component ofwind turbine10. For example,processor64may be configured to determine224the control algorithm parameter. More specifically,processor64may be configured to determine224a control algorithm gain, for example, a proportional gain and/or an integration gain, that control a response bandwidth, a response speed and/or a control error range, dependent upon upwind wind turbulence intensity.The wind turbine response bandwidth and response speed control a speed at which components ofwind turbine10reach a control target setting. In one example, the quickest that variable blade pitch system42(shown inFIG. 2) is able to change a pitch ofblades24by ten degrees may be ten seconds. However, in the exemplary embodiment, variableblade pitch system42is able to change the pitch ofblades24more slowly. Increasing the response bandwidth and/or response speed facilitates achieving desired positions of wind turbine components more quickly. Having wind turbine components in desired positions more quickly, and therefore a higher percentage of the time, facilitates increased wind turbine performance (i.e., higher efficiency and more stable output power). However, increasing the response bandwidth/speed also decreases stability of the wind turbine components. For example, increasing the component response speed may increase wind turbine component oscillation during periods of time with high wind turbulence intensity. Slowing the component response bandwidth/speed during periods of time with high wind turbulence intensity may reduce wind turbine performance, but it increases wind turbine stability by reducing rapid and frequent adjustments to wind turbine components.Examples of wind turbine control error ranges include a blade pitch error range and a generator torque error range. The blade pitch error range is a range surrounding a blade pitch control target. In a specific example, the blade pitch control target is positioning the blade at twenty-four degrees. The blade pitch error range may be four degrees (e.g., twenty-four degrees plus or minus four degrees). The generator torque error range is a range surrounding a generator torque control target. In a specific example, the generator torque control target is approximately five million newton meters (Nm). The generator torque error range may be two percent (e.g., five million Nm plus or minus two percent). Increasing control error ranges facilitates decreasing oscillation of wind turbine components within a range surrounding the control target until achieving a position within the error rangeA control algorithm gain may be stored, for example, in memory66(shown inFIG. 3). The stored control algorithm gain may correspond to rated operation ofwind turbine10. In the exemplary embodiment, determining224the control algorithm gain includes reducing the stored control algorithm gain when the measured wind turbulence intensity is greater than a first stored wind turbulence intensity, increasing the stored control algorithm gain when the measured wind turbulence intensity is less than a second stored wind turbulence intensity, and maintaining the stored control algorithm gain when the measured wind turbulence intensity is less than the first stored wind turbulence intensity and greater than the second stored wind turbulence intensity. Reducing the control algorithm gain increases at least one of a wind turbine component response time to the wind turbine operating command and the blade pitch error range and the generator torque error range. Increasing the wind turbine operating response time and the blade pitch and generator torque error ranges facilitates reducing wind turbine component oscillation.Increasing the control algorithm gain decreases at least one of the wind turbine component response time to the wind turbine operating command and the blade pitch error range and the generator torque error range. Decreasing the wind turbine component response time and the blade pitch and generator torque error ranges facilitates increasing wind turbine performance.In the exemplary embodiment,method210also includes determining226a wind turbine operating command based at least partially on the control algorithm parameter and applying228the wind turbine operating command to wind turbine operation. For example,processor64may be configured to determine226a blade pitch command that facilitates setting a blade pitch within a blade pitch error range of a blade pitch control target.Processor64may also be configured to determine226a generator torque command that facilitates setting a generator torque within a generator torque error range of a generator torque control target.In the exemplary embodiment,method210also includes determining230at least one wind turbine set point based at least partially on the measured wind condition. For example,processor64may be configured to determine230at least one of a power set point and a rotor speed set point based at least partially on a measured wind direction and/or a measured wind speed. The power set point and rotor speed set point may be reduced from stored rated values when the measured wind speed is greater than a stored maximum wind speed.The above described methods and system for operating a wind turbine facilitate cost effective and highly reliable operation of the wind turbine. The methods and system described herein facilitate increasing power production by proactively adjusting wind turbine operation based on approaching wind conditions, while also balancing the torque applied to the wind turbine from the wind and the torque applied to the wind turbine by the generator. The methods and system described herein also facilitate balancing wind turbine performance with wind turbine stability. During periods of time having low wind turbulence intensity, higher wind turbine performance is achieved by increasing a control algorithm gain, which increases a wind turbine response bandwidth/speed and/or reduces a wind turbine control error range. During periods of time having high wind turbulence intensity, higher stability is achieved by decreasing the control algorithm gain, which decreases the wind turbine response bandwidth/speed and/or increases the wind turbine control error range. More specifically, the above described system and methods facilitate operating a wind turbine with higher performance when wind conditions, for example, a wind turbulence intensity, are conducive to less stable operation.Exemplary embodiments of a wind turbine are described above in detail.

       "  'description': 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe field of the invention relates generally to control of wind turbine operation, and more specifically to determining monitor set point limits for a wind turbine based on a measured atmospheric condition.Wind turbine generators utilize wind energy to produce electrical power. Wind turbine generators typically include a wind rotor having multiple blades that transform wind energy into rotational motion of a drive shaft, which in turn is utilized to drive a rotor of an electrical generator to produce electrical power.Changes in atmospheric conditions, for example, wind speed, may significantly influence power produced by wind turbine generators. A power output of a wind turbine generator increases with wind speed until the wind speed reaches a rated wind speed for the turbine. At and above the rated wind speed, the turbine operates at a rated power. The rated power is a predetermined output power at which a wind turbine generator can operate with a level of fatigue to turbine components that is predetermined to be acceptable. At wind speeds higher than a certain speed, typically referred to as a “trip limit” or “monitor set point limit,” wind turbines may be shut down, or the loads may be reduced by regulating the pitch of the blades or braking the rotor, in order to protect turbine components from damage. Static trip limits are typically determined during a design stage of the wind turbine and therefore are not dependent upon changing conditions that may be present during operation of the wind turbine. Typically, a wind turbine shut down is costly. Maintenance costs may be incurred in order to re-start the wind turbine and energy production is lost while the wind turbine remains shut down.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONIn one aspect, a method for controlling operation of a wind turbine is provided.

As used herein, the term “wind turbine” is intended to be representative of any device that generates rotational energy from wind energy, and more specifically, converts kinetic energy of wind into mechanical energy. As used herein, the term “wind generator” is intended to be representative of any wind turbine that generates electrical power from rotational energy generated from wind energy, and more specifically, converts mechanical energy converted from kinetic energy of wind to electrical power. As used herein, the term “windmill” is intended to be representative of any wind turbine that uses rotational energy generated from wind energy, and more specifically mechanical energy converted from kinetic energy of wind, for a predetermined purpose other than generating electrical power, such as, but not limited to, pumping a fluid and/or grinding a substance.FIG. 1is a perspective view of anexemplary wind turbine10.FIG. 2is a partially cut-away perspective view of a portion ofwind turbine10.Wind turbine10described and illustrated herein is a wind generator for generating electrical power from wind energy. However, in some embodiments,wind turbine10may be, in addition or alternative to a wind generator, any type of wind turbine, such as, but not limited to, a windmill (not shown). Moreover,wind turbine10described and illustrated herein includes a horizontal-axis configuration. However, in some embodiments,wind turbine10may include, in addition or alternative to the horizontal-axis configuration, a vertical-axis configuration (not shown).Wind turbine10may be coupled to an electrical load (not shown), such as, but not limited to, a power grid (not shown), for receiving electrical power therefrom to drive operation ofwind turbine10and/or its associated components and/or for supplying electrical power generated bywind turbine10thereto. Although only onewind turbine10is shown inFIGS. 1-3, in some embodiments, a plurality ofwind turbines10may be grouped together, sometimes referred to as a “wind farm.”Wind turbine10includes abody12, sometimes referred to as a “nacelle,” and a rotor (generally designated by14) coupled tobody12for rotation with respect tobody12about an axis ofrotation20. In the exemplary embodiment,nacelle12is mounted on atower16. However, in some embodiments, in addition or alternative to tower-mountednacelle12,wind turbine10includes anacelle12adjacent the ground and/or a surface of water. The height oftower16may be any suitable height enablingwind turbine10to function as described herein.Rotor14includes ahub22and a plurality of blades24(sometimes referred to as “airfoils”) extending radially outwardly fromhub22for converting wind energy into rotational energy. Althoughrotor14is described and illustrated herein as having threeblades24,rotor14may have any number ofblades24.Blades24may each have any length that allowswind turbine10to function as described herein. For example, in some embodiments, one ormore rotor blades24are about one-half meter long, while in some embodiments one ormore rotor blades24are about fifty meters long. Other examples ofblade24lengths include ten meters or less, about twenty meters, about thirty-seven meters, and about forty meters. Still other examples include rotor blades between about fifty and about one-hundred meters long.Despite howrotor blades24are illustrated inFIG. 1,rotor14may haveblades24of any shape, and may haveblades24of any type and/or any configuration, whether such shape, type, and/or configuration is described and/or illustrated herein. One example of another type, shape, and/or configuration ofrotor blades24is a ducted rotor (not shown) having a turbine (not shown) contained within a duct (not shown). Another example of another type, shape, and/or configuration ofrotor blades24is a darrieus wind turbine, sometimes referred to as an “eggbeater” turbine. Yet another example of another type, shape, and/or configuration ofrotor blades24is a savonious wind turbine. Even another example of another type, shape, and/or configuration ofrotor blades24is a traditional windmill for pumping water, such as, but not limited to, four-bladed rotors having wooden shutters and/or fabric sails. Moreover,wind turbine10may, in some embodiments, be a wind turbine whereinrotor14generally faces upwind to harness wind energy, and/or may be a wind turbine whereinrotor14generally faces downwind to harness energy. Of course, in any of the embodiments,rotor14may not face exactly upwind and/or downwind, but may face generally at any angle (which may be variable) with respect to a direction of the wind to harness energy therefrom.Referring now toFIGS. 2,wind turbine10includes anelectrical generator26coupled torotor14for generating electrical power from the rotational energy generated byrotor14.Generator26may be any suitable type of electrical generator, such as, but not limited to, a wound rotor induction generator.Generator26includes a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not shown).Rotor14includes arotor shaft28coupled torotor hub22for rotation therewith.Generator26is coupled torotor shaft28such that rotation ofrotor shaft28drives rotation of the generator rotor, and therefore operation ofgenerator26. In the exemplary embodiment, the generator rotor has agenerator shaft30coupled thereto and coupled torotor shaft28such that rotation ofrotor shaft28drives rotation of the generator rotor. In other embodiments, the generator rotor is directly coupled torotor shaft28, sometimes referred to as a “direct-drive wind turbine.” In the exemplary embodiment,generator shaft30is coupled torotor shaft28through agearbox32, although in otherembodiments generator shaft30is coupled directly torotor shaft28.The torque ofrotor14drives the generator rotor to thereby generate variable frequency AC electrical power from rotation ofrotor14.Generator26has an air gap torque between the generator rotor and stator that opposes the torque ofrotor14. Afrequency converter34is coupled togenerator26for converting the variable frequency AC to a fixed frequency AC for delivery to an electrical load (not shown), such as, but not limited to a power grid (not shown), coupled togenerator26.Frequency converter34may be located anywhere within or remote towind turbine10. For example,frequency converter34may be located within a base (not shown) oftower16.In some embodiments,wind turbine10may include a rotor speed limiter, for example, but not limited to adisk brake36.Disk brake36brakes rotation ofrotor14to, for example, slow rotation ofrotor14,brake rotor14against full wind torque, and/or reduce the generation of electrical power fromelectrical generator26. Furthermore, in some embodiments,wind turbine10may include ayaw system38for rotatingnacelle12about an axis ofrotation39for changing a yaw ofrotor14, and more specifically for changing a direction faced byrotor14to, for example, adjust an angle between the direction faced byrotor14and a direction of wind.FIG. 3is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment ofwind turbine10. In the exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10includes one ormore system controllers40coupled to some or all of the components ofwind turbine10for generally controlling operation ofwind turbine10and/or controlling operation of some or all of the components thereof, regardless of whether such components are described and/or illustrated herein. For example, in the exemplaryembodiment system controller40is coupled to arotor control46for generally controllingrotor14. In the exemplary embodiment,system controller40is mounted within nacelle12(shown inFIG. 2). However, additionally or alternatively, one ormore system controllers40may be remote fromnacelle12and/or other components ofwind turbine10.System controller40may be used for, but is not limited to, overall system monitoring and control including, for example, pitch and speed regulation, high-speed shaft and yaw brake application, yaw and pump motor application, and/or fault monitoring. Alternative distributed or centralized control architectures may be used in some embodiments.In an exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10includes a plurality of sensors, for example,sensors48,50,52,54,56, and58.Sensors48,50,52,54,56, and58measure a variety of parameters, including, but not limited to, operating conditions and atmospheric conditions. Each ofsensors48,50,52,54,56, and58may be an individual sensor or a plurality of sensors.Sensors48,50,52,54,56, and58may be any suitable sensor having any suitable location within or remote towind turbine10that allowswind turbine10to function as described herein. In some embodiments,sensors48,50,52,54,58, and58are coupled tosystem controller40for transmitting measurements tosystem controller40for processing thereof.In some embodiments,system controller40includes a bus62or other communications device to communicate information. One or more processor(s)64are coupled to bus62to process information, including information fromsensors48,50,52,54,56,58and/or other sensor(s).System controller40may also include one or more random access memories (RAM)66and/or other storage device(s)68. RAM(s)66and storage device(s)68are coupled to bus62to store and transfer information and instructions to be executed by processor(s)64. RAM(s)66(and/or also storage device(s)68, if included) can also be used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor(s)64.System controller40may also include one or more read only memories (ROM)70and/or other static storage devices coupled to bus62to store and provide static (i.e., non-changing) information and instructions to processor(s)64.System controller40may also include, or may be coupled to, input/output device(s)72. Input/output device(s)72may include any device known in the art to provide input data tosystem controller40and/or to provide outputs, such as, but not limited to, yaw control and/or pitch control outputs. Instructions may be provided tomemory66fromstorage device68, such as, but not limited to, a magnetic disk, a read-only memory (ROM) integrated circuit, CD-ROM, and/or DVD, via a remote connection that is either wired or wireless providing access to one or more electronically-accessible media, etc. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry can be used in place of or in combination with software instructions. Thus, execution of sequences of instructions is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software instructions, whether described and/or illustrated herein.System controller40may also include asensor interface74that allowssystem controller40to communicate withsensors48,50,52,54,56,58and/or other sensor(s).Sensor interface74may include one or more analog-to-digital converters that convert analog signals into digital signals that can be used by processor(s)64.Wind turbine10is generally configured to operate at a rated power set point. The rated power set point is a predetermined output power at whichwind turbine10can operate with a level of fatigue to turbine components that is predetermined to be acceptable. Typically, the rated power set point is static. Furthermore, certain operating conditions ofwind turbine10are monitored and compared to stored monitor set point limits (i.e., trip limits). Typically, the monitor set point limits are static, pre-set limits. Typically, if a measured operating condition violates a stored monitor set point limit (e.g., meets or exceeds the stored monitor set point limit),wind turbine10is shut down. Examples of monitor set point limits include, but are not limited to, a generator shaft rotation speed monitor set point limit, a generator shaft torque monitor set point limit, a blade pitch asymmetry monitor set point limit, an electrical power output monitor set point limit, a wind turbine vibration monitor set point limit, and a wind turbine component temperature monitor set point limit.More specifically, in an exemplary embodiment,sensors48,50,52,54, and56measure operating conditions ofwind turbine10.Sensor48may include multiple sensors, each sensor coupled to acorresponding blade24for measuring a pitch of eachblade24, or more specifically an angle of eachblade24with respect to a wind direction and/or with respect torotor hub22. The measured pitch of oneblade24is compared to the measured pitch of anotherblade24to determine a pitch asymmetry. Typically, if the pitch asymmetry is determined to be greater than a static, pre-set blade pitch asymmetry monitor set point limit,wind turbine10is shut down.In an exemplary embodiment, one ormore sensors50are coupled togenerator shaft30for measuring a speed of rotation and/or a torque ongenerator shaft30. Moreover, in an exemplary embodiment, one ormore sensors52are coupled torotor shaft28for measuring a speed of rotation ofrotor shaft28and/or a torque onrotor shaft28. Typically, if the measured speed of rotation ofrotor shaft28and/orgenerator shaft30is greater than a static, pre-set shaft rotation speed monitor set point limit,wind turbine10is shut down. The shaft rotation speed monitor set point limit may also be referred to herein as an over speed monitor set point limit.Furthermore, in the exemplary embodiment, one ormore sensors54are coupled togenerator26for measuring an electrical power output ofgenerator26. Typically, if the measured electrical power output ofgenerator26meets or exceeds a static, pre-set electrical power output monitor set point limit,wind turbine10is shut down.In the exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10also includes sensor56, which is coupled tosystem controller40viasensor interface74. In the exemplary embodiment, sensor56measures temperatures and vibration levels of components or materials withinwind turbine10during operation ofwind turbine10. Typically, if a measured operating temperature or operating vibration level exceeds a static, pre-set temperature or vibration level monitor set point limit,wind turbine10is shut down. For example, if a measured gearbox oil temperature exceeds a pre-set operational temperature monitor set point limit,wind turbine10may be shut down.In the exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10also includesatmospheric condition sensor58coupled tosystem controller40viasensor interface74.Atmospheric condition sensor58may include one or more individual sensors configured to measure conditions of the environment surroundingwind turbine10, for example, but not limited to, an ambient air temperature, an ambient air pressure, an ambient air density, a wind speed, a wind shear, and an air turbulence intensity. Atmospheric conditions measured bysensor58are provided tosystem controller40, and may be used bysystem controller40alone or in combination with environmental condition data stored in, for example,storage device68. In the exemplary embodiment,system controller40determines at least one monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured atmospheric conditions and/or stored environmental condition data.The effect wind has onwind turbine10is dependent on atmospheric conditions of the environment wherewind turbine10is positioned. For example, relatively low air pressure periods of time typically correspond to periods of time having high wind speeds. Also, air pressure corresponds to air density, therefore, relatively low air pressure periods of time correspond to relatively low air density. Air density impacts the load spectrum ofwind turbine10. Higher air density produces higher wind turbine loads. For example, denser air imparts more force onwind turbine blades24than less dense air at the same wind speed. Furthermore, due to the greater forces imparted onblades24, wind gusts have a greater effect onwind turbine10during periods of relatively high air density.In the exemplary embodiment, applying variable monitor set point limits facilitates reducing unnecessary shut downs ofwind turbine10when compared to the application of static, pre-set monitor set point limits. In the exemplary embodiment, the variable monitor set point limits are based at least partially on a measured atmospheric condition and/or a measured operating condition. As described above, in at least some embodiments, measured operating conditions may include, but are not limited to, temperatures and/or vibration levels of components or materials withinwind turbine10. Also, in at least some embodiments, measured atmospheric conditions may include, but are not limited to, an ambient air temperature, an ambient air pressure, an ambient air density, a wind speed, a wind shear, and an air turbulence intensity.For example, during periods of time with relatively low wind shear, it may be determined that applying a modified monitor set point limit would not increase a stress onwind turbine10beyond a level of stress present onwind turbine10during normal wind shear conditions at the static, pre-set monitor set point limits. More specifically, during periods of time with relatively low wind shear, it may be determined that applying a higher yaw error monitor set point limit than a static pre-set yaw error monitor set point limit would not increase stress onwind turbine10beyond a level of stress present onwind turbine10during normal wind shear conditions at the static, pre-set yaw error monitor set point limit.In the exemplary embodiment,atmospheric condition sensor58also measures an air turbulence intensity and providessystem controller40with turbulence intensity data.System controller40may then determine the variable monitor set point limit based at least partially on the air turbulence intensity. In an alternative embodiment, a turbulence intensity value is stored instorage device68. For example, the turbulence intensity value is determined based on a wind turbulence assessment performed at the location wherewind turbine10is positioned. The wind turbulence assessment is performed over a period of time, to determine a static turbulence intensity value for a wind turbine positioned at a particular location. Although the turbulence intensity value is a static value, the turbulence intensity value may be periodically re-determined using data fromatmospheric condition sensor58and again stored in, for example,storage device68.In at least some embodiments, the variable monitor set point limit is based at least partially on an ambient air temperature.Atmospheric condition sensor58, in one embodiment, measures air temperature andsystem controller40determines at least one variable monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured air temperature. In at least some embodiments, the variable monitor set point limit is based at least partially on ambient air density.Atmospheric condition sensor58may directly measure the air density of the environment wherewind turbine10is positioned. Alternatively, the air density may be determined using a combination of measured and stored data. For example, it is known that air temperature is inversely related to air density. At a given altitude, air will have a greater air density at a lower temperature than the air would have at a higher temperature. Conversely, at a given altitude, air will have a lower air density at a higher temperature than the air would have at a lower temperature. In the alternative exemplary embodiment,atmospheric condition sensor58may measure the ambient air temperature (e.g., a dry-bulb temperature), which typically will vary over time.Wind turbine10is typically installed at a fixed altitude, which may be stored instorage device68. The altitude at whichwind turbine10is installed includes the elevation of the land on whichwind turbine10is installed, in addition to a length of tower16(shown inFIG. 1). The altitude may also be referred to as a “hub height,” which is the altitude of axis of rotation20(shown inFIG. 1). The air density may be calculated bysystem controller40using the measured air temperature and the stored altitude.Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, a variable rated power set point may also be determined based at least partially on the measured atmospheric conditions. For example,system controller40may determine the variable rated power set point based at least partially on data fromatmospheric condition sensor58. In some embodiments, the rated power set point may be determined based at least partially on the measured air pressure level. The measured air pressure level may be compared to a stored air pressure level and corresponding rated power set point. Alternatively,system controller40may modify a pre-set rated power set point based on the measured atmospheric conditions. For example, during the manufacture ofwind turbine10, a pre-set rated power set point may be determined forwind turbine10and programmed intosystem controller40. Alternatively, during testing ofwind turbine10, a pre-set rated power set point may be determined forwind turbine10and programmed intosystem controller40.In an exemplary embodiment,wind turbine10includes a variableblade pitch system76for controlling, including but not limited to changing, a pitch angle of rotor blades24(shown inFIGS. 1-3) with respect to a wind direction.Pitch system76may be coupled to system controller40(shown inFIG. 2) for control thereby.Pitch system76is coupled tohub22andblades24for changing the pitch angle ofblades24by rotatingblades24with respect tohub22. The pitch actuators may include any suitable structure, configuration, arrangement, means, and/or components, whether described and/or illustrated herein, such as, but not limited to, electrical motors, hydraulic cylinders, springs, and/or servomechanisms. Moreover, the pitch actuators may be driven by any suitable means, whether described and/or illustrated herein, such as, but not limited to, hydraulic fluid, electrical power, electro-chemical power, and/or mechanical power, such as, but not limited to, spring force.FIG. 4is aflowchart100of anexemplary method102for controlling operation of a wind turbine, for example, wind turbine10(shown inFIG. 1).Method102includes measuring110an atmospheric condition associated with the environment surroundingwind turbine10. As described above, atmospheric conditions may include an ambient air temperature, an ambient air pressure, an ambient air density, a wind speed, and/or a wind turbulence intensity. The method also includes providing112the measured atmospheric condition to a processor, for example,processor64of system controller40(shown inFIG. 3). The method also includes determining114at least one monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured110atmospheric condition. In some exemplary embodiments, determining114the monitor set point limit includes comparing the measured110atmospheric condition to a stored monitor set point limit/potential atmospheric condition combination.In some embodiments, an over speed set point limit, a blade pitch asymmetry set point limit, an operating temperature set point limit, and/or an operating vibration level set point limit may be determined114based on the measured atmospheric condition. For example,processor64may receive a measured air density and determine the over speed set point limit based on the measured air density. Alternatively, as described above,processor64may determine the over speed set point limit using any measured atmospheric conditions in combination with stored data. More specifically,processor64may determine the air density using the measured110air temperature, and at least one of a stored barometric pressure and a stored turbulence intensity value. As described above, the barometric pressure of air surroundingwind turbine10corresponds to the altitude at whichwind turbine10is positioned. As is also described above, the turbulence intensity value is a fixed value determined after a wind turbulence assessment. Therefore, the air density may be determined based on the fixed barometric pressure and turbulence intensity values, and the measured110air temperature. Since denser air imparts more force on wind turbine blades than less dense air at the same wind speed, higher monitor set point limits may be applied when temperatures are conducive.In some example embodiments, determining114the monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured110atmospheric condition also includes modifying a pre-set monitor set point limit based on the measured110atmospheric condition. For example, during the manufacture ofwind turbine10, a pre-set monitor set point limit may be determined forwind turbine10and programmed intosystem controller40. Alternatively, during testing ofwind turbine10, a pre-set monitor set point limit may be determined forwind turbine10and programmed intosystem controller40. As described above, the monitor set point limits are trip limits that when violated, indicate thatwind turbine10should be shut down. In the exemplary embodiment, atmospheric condition sensor58(shown inFIG. 3) facilitates modifying a pre-set monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured110atmospheric condition.In the exemplary embodiment, modifying the pre-set monitor set point limit includes increasing the pre-set monitor set point limit by a predetermined amount when the measured110atmospheric condition is above a predetermined level. As described above, in relative terms, when the temperature is high at a given altitude, the air density is low. Therefore, the force the wind will impart on a rotor blade, for example, rotor blade24(shown inFIG. 1), is also lower than when the air temperature is lower. Also,wind turbine10will be less influenced by high wind gusts when the air temperature is high, and corresponding air density is low, because those high wind gusts do not impart as much force on wind rotor blades24(shown inFIG. 1) as an equal level of wind gust would impart onwind rotor blades24under lower air temperature conditions. Providing112the measured atmospheric condition tosystem controller40, and determining114the monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured110atmospheric condition, facilitates increasing a monitor set point limit when air density conditions are conducive, and therefore, potentially preventing unnecessary shutdowns ofwind turbine10without raising the risk ofdamaging wind turbine10or adding fatigue towind turbine10operation.Method102also includes applying120the at least one monitor set point limit to wind turbine operation. Applying120may include shutting downwind turbine10if the monitor set point limit is violated. In the exemplary embodiment, at least one operating condition associated with operation ofwind turbine10is monitored. For example, a rotational speed of a shaft (e.g.,shaft30, shown inFIG. 2), a vibration level, a variation of wind across a horizontal and vertical plane ofwind turbine10, an operating temperature of a component, a blade angle, and/or a yaw error may be measured. If a measured operating condition meets or exceeds the monitor set point limit,wind turbine10is shut down. For example, applying120may include determining operating instructions for adjustable components ofwind turbine10that facilitate a shut down ofwind turbine10. More specifically, determining operating instructions for adjustable components ofwind turbine10may include, but is not limited to including, determining operating instructions for a rotor speed limiting system, for example, but not limited to, disk brake36(shown inFIG. 2), and for a rotor blade pitch system, for example, rotor blade pitch system76(shown inFIG. 2). Therefore, applying120may include controlling disk brake36(shown inFIG. 2), and controlling rotor blade pitch system76(shown inFIG. 2).FIG. 5is aflowchart140of anexemplary method142for assembling a wind turbine, for example wind turbine10(shown inFIG. 1), configured to operate with at least one variable monitor set point limit.Method142includes positioning150an atmospheric condition sensor at a position external to a body of a wind turbine. For example, atmospheric condition sensor58(shown inFIG. 3) may be positioned external to body12(shown inFIG. 1) of wind turbine10(shown inFIG. 1).Atmospheric condition sensor58may also be positioned150on an external surface ofbody12or tower16(shown inFIG. 1), positioned remotely fromwind turbine10, or positioned at any other position that allows determination of the atmospheric condition of the environment in whichwind turbine10is installed. In the exemplary embodiment,method142also includescoupling152atmospheric condition sensor58to a processor, for example, processor64(shown inFIG. 3).In the exemplary embodiment,method142also includes configuring154processor64to determine at least one monitor set point limit based at least partially on an atmospheric condition measured by the atmospheric condition sensor. In some embodiments,processor64is configured154to periodically determine the monitor set point limit at predetermined intervals of time. For example,processor64may be configured154to determine the monitor set point limit ofwind turbine10once every minute. In another example,processor64may be configured154to determine the monitor set point limit ofwind turbine10once every five minutes. In yet another example,processor64may be configured154to continuously determine the monitor set point limit ofwind turbine10based at least partially on the measured atmospheric condition.As described above, in an exemplary embodiment,processor64is included within system controller40(shown inFIG. 3). In some example embodiments,processor64is configured to compare a measured atmospheric condition to a stored atmospheric condition to determine corresponding monitor set point limits. Also, in some embodiments,processor64is further configured to modify a pre-set monitor set point limit by an amount determined by the comparison of measured atmospheric condition to stored atmospheric condition and corresponding monitor set point limits.Method142facilitates assemblingwind turbine10to includeatmospheric condition sensor58, which facilitates operatingwind turbine10with a variable monitor set point limit. Although described as a method for assemblingwind turbine10,method142illustrated inFIG. 5also facilitates retrofitting a currently operational wind turbine withatmospheric condition sensor58, and the ability to calculate a variable monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured atmospheric condition.FIG. 6is aflowchart170of anexemplary method172for facilitating operating a wind turbine, for example, wind turbine10(shown in FIG.1), having at least one variable monitor set point limit. In the exemplary embodiment,method172includes configuring180an atmospheric condition sensor, for example, atmospheric condition sensor58(shown inFIG. 3) to providewind turbine10with at least one atmospheric condition measurement. More specifically,atmospheric condition sensor58is configured180to provide a system controller ofwind turbine10, for example, system controller40(shown inFIG. 3), with atmospheric condition measurements.Method172also includes configuringsystem controller40to receive188the atmospheric condition measurements, to determine190the at least one variable monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured atmospheric conditions, and to apply192the at least one variable monitor set point limit to operation ofwind turbine10. In some embodiments, applying192the at least one variable monitor set point limit includes determining192operating instructions for adjustable components ofwind turbine10and providing196the operating instructions to adjustable components ofwind turbine10.Configuringsystem controller40to determine190the monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured atmospheric condition may include storing predetermined monitor set point limits and corresponding potential atmospheric conditions in a memory, for example, ROM70(shown inFIG. 3). Configuringsystem controller40to determine190the monitor set point limit may also include comparing the measured atmospheric condition to the stored potential atmospheric conditions and corresponding monitor set point limits. In some example embodiments, configuringsystem controller40to determine190the monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured atmospheric condition also includes modifying a pre-set monitor set point limit based on the measured atmospheric condition. For example, during the manufacture ofwind turbine10, a monitor set point limit may be determined forwind turbine10and programmed intosystem controller40. Alternatively, during testing ofwind turbine10, a monitor set point limit may be determined forwind turbine10and programmed intosystem controller40. As described above, the monitor set point limits are trip limits that when violated, indicate thatwind turbine10should be shut down. In the exemplary embodiment, atmospheric condition sensor58(shown inFIG. 3) facilitates modifying a pre-set monitor set point limit based at least partially on the received188atmospheric condition measurement.As described above with respect tomethod102illustrated inFIG. 4, modifying the pre-set monitor set point limit includes increasing the pre-set monitor set point limit by a predetermined amount when the measured atmospheric condition is above a predetermined level. Configuringsystem controller40to determine190the monitor set point limit based at least partially on the measured air temperature, and to determine194operating instructions for adjustable components of the wind turbine to apply the monitor set point limit facilitates preventing unnecessary wind turbine shut downs without raising the risk ofdamaging wind turbine10or adding fatigue towind turbine10operation.FIG. 7is aflowchart250of an exemplary process executed by a wind turbine system controller, for example, system controller40(shown inFIG. 2) of wind turbine10(shown inFIG. 2).Flowchart250illustrates steps of an exemplary computer program embodied on a computer readable medium for determining at least one monitor set point limit forwind turbine10. The computer program illustrated inflowchart250includes at least one code segment that receives260atmospheric condition data provided by an atmospheric condition sensor, for example, atmospheric condition sensor58(shown inFIG. 3). The computer program illustrated inflowchart250also includes at least one code segment that determines262the at least one monitor set point limit forwind turbine10based at least partially on the received atmospheric condition data. Furthermore, the computer program illustrated inflowchart250may also include at least one code segment that determines264operating instructions for adjustable components ofwind turbine10, and provides266the operating instructions to the adjustable components ofwind turbine10. As described above with respect toflowcharts100,140, and170, the process illustrated inflowchart250facilitates varying the monitor set point limit ofwind turbine10based at least partially on a measured atmospheric condition.The above described system and methods for operating a wind turbine facilitate cost effective and highly reliable operation of the wind turbine. A technical effect of the system and methods described herein includes at least one of determining at least one monitor set point limit for a wind turbine based at least partially on a measured atmospheric condition and applying the variable monitor set point limit to operation of the wind turbine.

       "  'description': \"BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to wind turbines, and more particular to low resistance, vertical axis wind turbines that utilize a unique airfoil design to enhance rotation in winds from a single direction, multiple directions including winds blowing from directly above, and cyclonic winds.In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for energy in all forms including fuels and electricity for heating, lighting, transportation and manufacturing processes due to the world's population rapidly increasing, the supply and price-volatility problems of using petroleum and other “fossil” fuels for energy, and the accelerated technological development of large sectors of the world. Despite the construction of hydroelectric facilities and the development of fossil fuel resources at a rapid rate, it has become increasingly evident these efforts are inadequate to keep pace with the growing population's demand. First, fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas are increasingly becoming higher in cost and their availability is limited. Second, the hope that nuclear power would soon lead to a rapid solution of the energy dilemma has been tempered by environmental and safety concerns.In the face of these growing demands and the resulting research in many fields of energy, wind energy has once again become the focus of such research, in part because the source of such energy, namely wind, is readily available to every country in the world in virtually unlimited quantities, subject only to use of wind turbines or other devices capable of converting the motive force of the wind into energy in a form usable by modern technologies. The interest in the development and harnessing of wind energy for use in homes and factories in the form of electricity is rising as with the rising costs and prices of traditional fossil fuel energy. Wind energy is also desirable because it can be converted to practical use without environmental contamination or chemical air pollution concerns.One method of converting wind energy to practical use is through the use of a wind turbine. Traditional wind turbines, including what is historically known as a windmill, are horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs), wherein blades or vanes are secured to a horizontally supported shaft. As wind impinges on the blades, the horizontal shaft rotates, which rotation can then be translated into electric energy. Typically, the horizontal shaft itself pivots about a horizontal axis (hence the “horizontal axis wind turbine” name) so that the shaft and blades can pivot with the prevailing wind direction so that the shaft and blades can change their orientation as the winds change direction. One drawback to HAWTs is the inefficiencies caused by friction arising from the supported shaft. HAWT turbines utilize bearings for turning, and such bearings can wear out and need replacement. An additional drawback to HAWT turbines is that only the prevailing wind from a single direction can be “harnessed” at any one time to generate energy, so that the HAWT design can be inefficient or the blades and associated gearing can be damaged in changeable or turbulent winds, due to torque. Another drawback is that HAWT wind turbines may not turn or may need mechanical assistance to begin turning, if the wind speed is too low to counter the inertia of the HAWT rotator and bearings.More recent developments in wind turbine technology have focused on vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), wherein a foil or vane is mounted on a vertically supported axis. Because of their vertical axes of rotation, VAWTs do not require alignment with the direction from which the wind is blowing. Prior art VAWTs include drag-based designs that move by being pushed by the wind, and lift-based designs which move from lift that is developed by the vanes. These prior art designs suffer inefficiencies due to drag during part of the rotation, which is a consequence of the vane shapes and gearing.Various attempts have been made in the prior art to develop a method for utilizing wind energy by use of a vertical axis type windmill/wind-turbine. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 226,357 issued Apr. 6, 1880, describes a drag-based vertical axis windmill design. This patent teaches a windmill design that utilizes flat “fans” mounted pivotally on a support structure to catch wind and cause the support structure to rotate. As the fans orbit the vertical axis, they pivot between a downwind orientation, presenting a broad area that catches the wind, and an upwind orientation in which a narrower profile passes before the wind in order to create less drag. One drawback to this design is that the flat fans are not very aerodynamic in design and thus operation is rough and slow, with the fans being pulled out of position by centrifugal force. The fans provide drive only intermittently during a somewhat small portion of each rotation. Further, upright structural bars at the outermost ends of the fans obstruct airflow and prevent the system from achieving rotor speeds faster than wind speed.Another illustration of the development of VAWT's is found in U.S. Pat. No. 2,038,467 issued on Apr. 21, 1936, wherein there is described a vertical axis drag-based windmill design that employs flat “vanes” on a rotating frame. The two-phase vanes are balanced on the vertical axis so that they pivot about 170 degrees between a high-drag position downwind and a low-drag position upwind. The windmill exhibits drag rotation over 180 degrees of each revolution, but vane interference of the upwind vane over the downwind vane in its wind shadow reduces overall effectiveness. Thus, the effective transference of force occurs over less than 180 degrees.Other VAWT prior art attempts utilizing a lift-based design. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,383,801 issued May 17, 1983, discloses a lift-based VAWT that includes vertically arranged vanes mounted pivotally on a rotating base. As the vanes catch the wind and move the support, they orbit the vertical axis. A wind-vane-controlled pitch adjustment continually orients the airfoils relative to the wind direction. The device detects wind direction by means of a vane and positions the controlling pitch flange accordingly. One drawback to this patent is that the positioning of the airfoils is truly effective only in the directly windward and directly leeward positions, using crosswind lift force in both cases.Another example of a lift-based VAWT is U.S. Pat. No. 6,688,842 issued Feb. 10, 2004. In this patent, a VAWT with “free flying” airfoils is taught, wherein the airfoils are self-positioning according to the local dynamic conditions to which they are subjected, thereby creating a condition of equilibrium in order to make the “engine” more efficient. More specifically, the patent teaches a vertical axis wind engine with a rotor mounted on a base for rotation about a vertical axis. One or more airfoil(s) is mounted on the rotor so that it is free to pivot between preset first and second limits of pivotal movement (e.g., set by stop mechanisms). That arrangement enables the airfoil to align according to the wind as it orbits the vertical axis, thereby achieving better conversion of wind energy to useable rotational energy by combining lift and drag characteristics at low speeds and shifting to lift-only characteristics at rotor speeds approaching or exceeding local wind speed. Wind forces and armature-constraining action establish airfoil positions. The airfoils rotate freely through an arc of approximately 90 degrees, bounded by stop mechanisms. The span of travel is from a radial line along the mounting arm (radially aligned relative to the vertical axis) to a perpendicular position (tangentially aligned relative to the vertical axis). This prior art design allows for each airfoil to set its own instantaneous angle and to adjust to conditions of relative wind, wind shift, and so forth occurring outside and within the wind engine, “without external adjustments or mechanisms, wind vanes, centrifugal governors, or other controlling devices.” Individual airfoils adjust to local conditions based on changes of rotor speed, turbulence, true relative wind, and other factors affecting each of them independently. A drawback to this design, however, is that the efficiency is limited because the airfoils rotate through only about a 90 degree arc (out of a possible 360 degrees) and are constrained by stops.A further drawback to the various VAWTs of the prior art is similar to those inefficiencies found in the HAWTs, namely that there is a relatively large amount of weight carried by the bearings that support vertically rotating component of the VAWTs. In addition to the loss of energy resulting from the friction between the relative components, this leads to the need to replace bearings on a regular basis.Notwithstanding the foregoing, in recent years various electricity generating utilities have conceived of the need to promote “distributed generation” of electricity as a means of decentralizing the commercial electricity grid, which suffers from centralized generation plants and switching and transmission lines that are sometimes old and in poor repair, such that a grid may become unstable and prone to outages of electrical power. In response and as a means of diminishing the risk of rising energy costs to the consumer, it has become more prevalent to generate electricity from renewable sources of energy using decentralized devices located on buildings or on land or in yards belonging to small commercial companies or even individuals. While it is most common in remote locations that this renewable-sourced electricity is generated solely for local consumption, in other locations where a grid connection is available, electrical utilities are offering “net metering”. Net metering equipment allows “co-generation” of electrical power, such that both the utility and the end user can generate electricity. Since the bi-directional electric meter accurately registers the flow of electricity in both directions, net metering not only helps to maximize the value of distributed generation, but does so with little cost to the consumer. In other words, the meter spins forward when the customer uses more electricity than is being produced, and spins backward when the customer is producing more electricity than is needed.Therefore, as interest in co-generation grows, there is a need for better, more efficient renewable-energy electricity generating devices. An improved VAWT capable of harnessing wind from a full 360 degrees of rotation about the vertical axis would be one such device. Desirably, the VAWT should also harness vertically impinging wind and cyclonic wind. The VAWT also should minimize inefficiencies arising from frictional losses. Preferably, the VAWT materials should maximize strength and durability but have a low cost of manufacture so as to be economically available to consumers for use in individual households.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThese and other benefits are found in the present invention which provides a lift and drag-based vertical axis wind turbine in which the vertical axis and foils mounted thereon are magnetically levitated above the turbine's base, thereby reducing friction within the system. The foils are shaped to maximize operation of the system, regardless of the wind direction. More specifically, the foils are three-dimensionally shaped about the vertical axis so as to resemble the billowed sail of a sailing ship; hereinafter the foils will be referred to as sails or vanes. The sails (or vanes) capture wind through a full 360 degrees of rotation under any wind condition. The system is further provided with an axial flux alternator using variable resistance coils which can be individually and selectively turned on or off depending on wind conditions and required electrical draw requirements. The coils can also be used to produce mechanical drag on the system if required to brake the turbine in high wind conditions or for maintenance. The system may be programmed to assess whether electricity generated by the system can be or should be transmitted to a public grid or stored locally on a chargeable battery system. Finally, the system may be programmed to report system usage such as the amount of electricity produced, the amount of electricity used and the amount of electricity sent to a grid or stored. Likewise, the system can report outages to individuals and local authorities.The system thus described is small, light in weight, and easy to install upon a flat or peaked rooftop. This vertical axis wind turbine is robust as to interaction with the weather. Most importantly, the present invention is capable of effectively using wind blowing from all sides simultaneously, including from above. Since the present invention is able to utilize wind from all directions, it can generate electricity even in low-speed winds. Also, since the wind turbine is magnetically leviated, the present invention is quiet in operation and, because the rotational bearings do not support the weight of the turbine sails, the bearings very seldom need replacement. The magnetic levitation results in very little spinning resistance, and hence, increased efficiencies. Efficiencies are also enhanced by the curved shape of the vanes or sails.It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved wind turbine design.A further object of this invention to provide a wind turbine design which is susceptible of a low cost of manufacture with regard to both materials and labor, and which accordingly is then susceptible of low prices of sale to the consuming public, thereby making wind generation of electricity economically available to the buying public.Another object of the present invention is to provide a wind turbine design that is manufactured with materials used in manufacture in order to maximize strength and durability while minimizing weight. The vanes or sails of the present invention can be manufactured from light, strong composite materials or light, strong metals that are able to maintain their structural integrity even in hurricane-force winds.Another object of the present invention is to provide a wind turbine design that allows the vanes or sails to be magnetically levitated so that no bearings are needed between the rotor and the base. This significantly decreases drag that might occur due to gravity and friction.Another object of the present invention is to provide a wind turbine design that is capable of utilizing wind energy from all directions. The sails are curved like those of a sailing ship in order to maximize the opportunity to scoop wind (which is the drag-driven component) from a larger area than a flat vane could. This also protects the device from contrary or turbulent winds such as might be prevalent during storms. Because of the sail shape, the present invention can tolerate and utilize winds blowing even from directly above the wind turbine, in a manner that other devices cannot. This means that the wind turbine can continue to operate during thunderstorms or hurricanes, or atop high buildings where significant wind turbulence may exist either continuously or as an intermittent condition. In such turbulent wind conditions, wind turbines of the prior art would have to be curtailed or “feathered” to prevent damage to the vanes and gearing of the wind turbine. The present invention has no such vulnerability.A further object of the present invention is to provide a wind turbine design that has a vane design that enhances the efficiency of the wind turbine by creating lift at certain rotational points when the vane rotation is in opposition to the direction of the wind. The sails are curved like those of a sailing ship in order to allow the wind turbine to create lift similar to a sailing ship in a “close haul.” Not only does this increase the efficiency of the wind turbine, but it also protects the device from contrary or turbulent winds.A further object of the present invention is to provide a wind turbine design that has a graceful shape, which makes it visually appealing, in a manner similar to “wind art.”BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1shows a side view of a magnetic vertical axis wind turbine of the present invention.FIG. 2depicts an exploded view of the magnetic vertical axis wind turbine of the present invention.FIG. 3illustrates a top view of a magnetic vertical axis wind turbine of the present invention.FIG. 4a cross section of the base of the magnetic vertical axis wind turbine of the present invention.FIG. 5shows an elevation view of a magnetic vertical axis wind turbine of the present invention.FIG. 6is a flow diagram illustrating certain functions of the winds turbine's controller.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTIn the detailed description of the invention, like numerals are employed to designate like parts throughout. Various items of equipment may be omitted to simplify the description. However, those skilled in the art will realize that such conventional equipment can be employed as desired.With reference toFIGS. 1 and 2, the magnetic verticalaxis wind turbine10of the present invention is illustrated. Specifically, there is shown a substantiallycircular base12defined by avertical edge14at its outer perimeter and acentral hub16. Acenter rod18attaches tocentral hub16and extends axially frombase12. Disposed around outer perimeter ofbase12onvertical edge14is a plurality ofmagnetic transformers20. Anaxial shaft22having afirst end24, asecond end26andaxial grooves28along its length is pivotally mounted oncenter rod18.Shaft22rotates axially relative torod18andbase12.Center bearings19may be positioned onrod18or withinshaft22to facilitate relative rotation and ensure axial alignment ofshaft22androd18. In one preferred embodiment,shaft22is segmented into multiple segments (in the case ofFIG. 2, four segments) andmultiple bearings19are utilized so that the height ofshaft22can be adjusted as desired. A top cap21may be placed over the topmost center bearing19.Mounted onshaft22is a substantially circular rotor or cover30which has an outwardly extendingsurface31terminating at an outer perimetervertical edge32. Disposed around theouter perimeter edge32ofrotor30is a plurality ofmagnets34.Rotor30is mounted onshaft22so as to be concentric withbase12, whereby theouter perimeter edge32ofrotor30is adjacent theouter perimeter edge14ofbase12such thatmagnets34are aligned withtransformers20in a horizontal plane. In one preferred embodiment, sixtymagnetic transformers20are provided onbase12and sixtymagnets34are provided onrotor30.Center rod18, being attached in a fixed non-rotational position to base12, in addition to providing support forshaft22androtor30, also provides alignment forbase12androtor30and hence theadjacent transformers20andmagnets34.Afirst levitating magnet36is mounted onbase12and asecond levitating magnet38is mounted onrotor30so thatmagnet36andmagnet38are adjacent one another whenrotor30andbase12are axially aligned. Those skilled in the art will understand that the polarities ofmagnets36and38are such that the magnets repel one another when mounted as described herein. In such case,rotor30will “levitate” abovebase12oncenter rod18. The levitatingmagnets36,38enablerotor30andvanes42, or wind turbine portion of the device, to “levitate” magnetically off ofbase12, thus providing substantially frictionless rotation ofrotor30relative tobase12and obviating the need for wheels or bearings therebetween. As such, the efficiency of thewind turbine10is increased because less energy is needed to overcome the resistance betweenrotor30andbase12. While any configuration ofmagnets36and38as disposed on correspondingbase12androtor30is possible, in the preferred embodiment, eachmagnet36,38is ring shaped and concentrically disposed inrecesses40defined onbase12androtor30.A plurality of triangular shapedvanes42are mounted onshaft22. Eachvane42is characterized by aninner edge44, anouter edge46and alower edge48. As further illustrated inFIG. 3,outer edge46is curved axially aboutinner edge44so as to define aninner surface50and anouter surface52forvane42. In one preferred embodiment,inner edge44is linear, whileedges46and48are curvilinear, thereby taking on the shape of the billowed sail of a sailboat. In any event,inner edge44ofvane42is disposed to mount in anaxial groove28ofshaft22so thatlower edge48abuts surface33ofrotor30and the distal end oflower edge48terminates adjacentvertical edge32ofrotor30.Vanes42are preferably equally spaced aboutshaft22in the same direction radially on top ofrotor30. In one preferred embodiment, eightvanes42are utilized.With reference toFIG. 4, one embodiment of a cross section of thebase12androtor30of the magnetic verticalaxis wind turbine10is illustrated, and more specifically, the relative positions ofmagnetic transformers20mounted onbase12andmagnets34mounted onrotor30are shown. In this embodiment, edge14ofbase12is illustrated as being located inwardly ofedge32ofrotor30, thereby protecting bothtransformers20andmagnets34from external exposure. Additionally,center rod18is shown secured inhub16ofbase12. Arecess40is shown in each ofbase12androtor30.Recesses40are axially positioned to face one another and are each disposed for receipt of theircorresponding levitating magnet36,38. A portion of shaft22(without anyvanes42shown) is illustrated and shown attached torotor12.Turning to the wind turbine component, or “wind engine”, of the invention, namely thevanes42, the shape and placement of the vanes are specifically provided to yield improvements in both rotation torque and efficiency. There is a five-step sequence to wind turbine technology that is generally known in the art:1. Upwind Lift Phase. This begins approximately in the upwind position and continues to approximately 60 degrees past it, depending on wind and rotor speed conditions.2. Downwind Drag Phase. This begins at approximately 60 degrees downwind and continues to around the 120 degree position.3. Transitional Phase. At about the 120 degree position, the airfoil rotates its orientation by 90 degrees and converts its rotational energy into rotor thrust by the law of conservation of rotational inertia.4. Leeward Lift Phase. Positioned crosswind by the transitional phase, the airfoil now sweeps across the leeward side of the system.5. Upwind Phase. The airfoil returns to windward, positioning itself for minimum drag.In the present invention, power is produced in four of the five phases, as more particularly described below.The verticalaxis wind turbine10is designed to be mounted on a roof top. When the wind strikes the roof and building at different angles throughout the year, the wind creates air currents coming from different directions, sometimes simultaneously. For example, if the wind is blowing from the other side of a roof peak, force is created by the wind that hits theturbine10directly, plus the wind that is redirected from hitting objects on the roof. These objects on the roof include roof vents, television satellite dishes, chimneys and the other elevated roofs. In addition, there may be vortices of wind turbulence curling back from over the roof and striking the turbine from above. Because of these conditions, most roof mounted prior art VAWTs have been ineffective. However, the vanes or sails42of the verticalaxis wind turbine10of the current invention are designed so that the wind can strike them from all directions simultaneously; this then causes thewind turbine10to spin faster.As described above, eachvane42preferably resembles a ship's sail, configured for a “close haul” to the wind. The overall visual effect gives thewind turbine10an appearance like an “auger” or “impeller.”To the extent that wind strikes thewind turbine10from a single direction, the curved shape of avane42allows thewind turbine10to catch the wind through 280 degrees of the rotation ofvane42. Specifically, for approximately 20 degrees,vane42luffs (does not catch any wind or face any wind)—similar to the sail of a sailboat. Through the next 100 degrees,vane42develops lift from the passage of the air over the curved shape ofvane42, similar to a sailboat with its sail configured for a “close haul”. Through another 40 degrees,vane42of thewind turbine10moves in opposition to the wind, creating “drag”. Through the final 20 degrees,vane42is in a luff position again.When wind impinges on allvanes42of thewind turbine10, somevanes42receive a “push” through 180 degrees at the same time asother vanes42receive wind through the 20 degrees of luff, while stillother vanes42receive force through the 100 degrees of lift and the remainingvanes42receive wind-force through the other 40 degrees of luff. As such, power is produced from four of the five phases discussed above, which is equivalent to at least 280 degrees out of 360 degrees of rotation. Further, because of themultiple vanes42utilized inturbine10, the drag and luff portions of onevane42may be offset by theother vanes42at any one moment in time.Significantly, the combined effect of push on one side and lift on the other side gives thewind turbine10the ability to spin faster than the speed of the wind from any one direction. Specifically, in a multiple wind-direction situation, i.e. when cyclonic winds blow from several directions at once or when the wind is blowing straight down upon thewind turbine10from above, allvanes42are experiencing more lift than drag through their entire rotation. The effect is that thewind turbine10actually spins faster when having winds strike it from more than one direction, and spins quickest of all when the wind is blowing from above. As such, it is possible forvanes42to spin much faster than the speed of the wind.With respect to generation of electricity, themagnetic transformers20andmagnets34are the principal components of what may be referred to as the axial flux alternator forturbine10. In the preferred embodiment,magnetic transformers20may be a cored coil or a coreless coil andmagnets34are passive magnets. Those skilled in the art will understand that the term “axial flux” refers to a type of alternator where magnets are mounted on disks and the flux between them is parallel to the axis of the shaft and is desirable for generating an electric current even when rotational speed is low. An electric current is produced bymagnetic transformer20asmagnets34are rotated past the transformers. In any event, the axial flux alternator arrangement described above is used in the current invention to generate an electric current. Themagnetic transformers20are incorporated as part of the circuit of the axial flux alternator. Moreover, whileFIG. 4illustratesedge14ofbase12being located inwardly ofedge32ofrotor30, the relative positions ofedges14and30could be reversed or anadditional edge14carryingadditional transformers20could be located outwardly ofedge32andmagnets34so as to maximize the amount of electricity produced byturbine10.While one preferred embodiment of the invention has been described with 60magnets34and 60magnetic transformers20, in another preferred embodiment of the invention,turbine10includes 100-300magnets34which pass over 100-400magnetic transformers20, or coils of wire, thus generating electricity by induction. In one example, the frequency of the current typically ranges from 100 cycles to 7500 cycles. Preferably, the current is first converted to DC and then back to AC 60 cycle current before it is conveyed to either electrically-powered machines (not shown), an electrical storage system, such as a battery system (not shown) or connected to a commercial electrical grid (not shown) for use by the local electrical utility.One novel feature of theturbine10is the ability to selectively activate and deactivatemagnetic transformers20as needed to control rotational drag. One drawback to the VAWTs of the prior art is that, with a full generator load holding it back, they are often very difficult to get started, i.e., generating sufficient torque to overcome friction creating drag on the rotating hub. In some prior art VAWTs, an electric motor was used to achieve a minimum rotation speed for the vanes (of those designs) in order to overcome this start-up drag. Because of the magnetic levitation system of the current invention, much of this frictional resistance or drag has been eliminated. However, theturbine10of the present invention also providesmagnetic transformers20, or variable resistance coreless coils, that can be turned on and off by a computer (not shown) to vary the drag onrotor30. Thesemagnetic transformers20do not produce electricity or drag on the system until they are turned on. This means that the drag on thewind turbine10can be controlled according to its rotational speed. The higher the speed, the moremagnetic transformers20that are turned on. Theturbine10has several hundredmagnetic transformers22that can be turned on and off to achieve the desired drag. In this regard, themagnetic transformers22can also operate to slow down thewind turbine10in high winds, but do not impede the rotation when winds are light and of little strength.A controller (not shown) forturbine10determines the number ofmagnetic transformers20that should be active at any given time. Preferably, a small number ofmagnetic transformers20are active at all times. Theturbine10may include a sensor (not shown) that can determine the rotational speed of thewind turbine10. The controller compares the rotational speed ofturbine10against the amount of electricity that is being produced from the activemagnetic transformers20. Once the controller has determined thatturbine10is spinning faster than the programmed optimum rpm range for a given amount of electrical generation, the controller may turn on additionalmagnetic transformers20. On the other hand, if the rotational speed ofturbine10slows, the controller may then turn off a select number ofmagnetic transformers20in order to increase the rotational speed.The wiring on themagnetic transformers20consists of four different patterns. All of themagnetic transformers20are wired to one of these patterns. The patterns keep the wave peak/trough canceling effect from reducing the amount of electricity produced. The patterns are North-North-South Gap-South-South North Gap. The role of the magnet orientation is thus: all the coils (transformers) that are going to be over a magnet oriented to a specific orientation are named the same and wired together. This means that all of thetransformers20in the North pattern will be over a North pole at the same time, and thereafter leave that pole at the same time. The coils used in wiring base12(which does not rotate, but remains stationary) are of coreless type because coreless coils only provide magnetic resistance when they are connected to a load. The interaction between therotating magnets34and thestationary coils20causes generation of electrical current. The high frequency electrical current from each wiring pattern flows to a rectifier to be converted into direct current (DC).Finally, the foregoing controller may also be programmed to assess whether electricity generated byturbine10can be transmitted to a public grid or should be stored locally, such as on a chargeable battery system. More specifically, the controller may be programmed to access or otherwise receive external data related to co-generation, power costs, and the availability of a public grid to receive co-generated electricity from theturbine10. Once the controller has evaluated these parameters, it can take appropriate action to control the electricity by deciding where to send the electricity.FIG. 6illustrates for example, if the controller determines it is not profitable to send electricity to a public grid, then the controller may direct the electricity to a local storage device. In another example, there may be no public draw connection or it could be that the need of the local public grid for co-generated electricity at that moment is zero. Likewise, the controller may evaluate the status of a local storage system, such as a large capacity uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and maintain a local database of such. The controller may decide to send some of the electricity to a local utility grid and some to a local storage system. For example, if the local storage system is a rechargeable battery system or a UPS, then the controller, by means of sensors, may determine whether the battery system is charged to 100% of capacity and take appropriate action to recharge to such a level. Local data may also consist of a historical database battery efficiency. Similarly, the controller may also monitor local energy usage and maintain a local database of historical energy usage and thus be ready to provide more energy at peak hours, less energy at off-peak hours, or generate a report or ‘alert’ if the local public grid is anomalous because of usage that could signal an equipment malfunction or other noteworthy condition. This is an important safety feature that can protect both the user of the wind turbine (for electricity generation), and also the electricians and line crews of the electricity-generation utility. It can also assist the utility in mapping or pinpointing localities where a grid outage exists, as discussed further below.If a local battery system is fully charged, then the controller may evaluate the value of the generated electricity in terms of energy market prices at that moment in terms of the price to efficiency ratio of the other connected storage device(s). The controller then decides whether the return amount of electricity justifies sending the electricity to one or another specific storage device.Finally, the controller may be programmed to report system usage such as the amount of electricity produced, the amount of electricity used and the amount of electricity sent to a grid or stored. Likewise, the system can report outages to individuals and local authorities. The controller may use a regular telephone line, WLAN, WIFI, or cellular telephone connection to obtain external data and to report both usage and outage conditions. Typically, a usage report would consist of the following: the amount of electricity produced by the wind speed (if equipped with an external anemometer), the amount of electricity used and the amount of electricity sent to the local electrical grid.Outage reporting may also occur when the meter or safety cut off switch indicates that there is no electricity on the grid side connection. A signal or report to the outage reporting center may be generated to indicate that there has been an outage and to confirm that the unit is no longer sending electricity to the grid. This signal or report may then be passed on to the local utility to create an outage “footprint” or map showing the units reporting the outage and the units not reporting.While certain features and embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein, it will be readily understood that the invention encompasses all modifications and enhancements within the scope and spirit of the following claims.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe Invention relates to wind turbines for production of electrical power. The invention is particularly applicable to wind generators that may be used in locations where high average winds are not expected but that nonetheless must survive adverse weather conditions and loadings specified by applicable building codes for wind turbines.2. Description of the Related ArtThe potential for wind power energy generation for a location is measured by a scale referred to as the ‘wind power class.’ There are seven ‘wind power classes,’ ranging fromclass1, with annual average wind speeds of less than 5.6 meters/sec at an elevation of 100 meters, toclass7, with annual average wind speeds of 8.8 meters/sec and above at an elevation of 100 meters. Much of the United States (and the world) has relatively low average wind speeds. For example, much of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania falls withinclasses3 or 4, with annual average wind speeds between 6.4 to 7.5 meters/sec at an elevation of 100 meters.The wind power industry has focused development of wind power in areas of relatively high average wind speed. The prior art wind generators currently available were developed for such areas. Such generators generate only a fraction of their nameplate rating when used in areas of lower average wind speed.Current-technology wind generators generally are horizontal up-wind wind turbines, with the axis of rotation of the blade horizontal to the ground and the rotating blade upwind of the supporting tower. The forces acting on the blade must be reacted (that is, opposed and supported) by the blade, blade root, hub including bearings, drive system and tower. Those forces include the steady force resulting from the weight of the blade and the varying force of the wind. The force of the wind acting on the blade varies along the span of the blade and varies with each revolution of the blade. Gusts, variable wind speeds and inclement weather can place a very high loading on the structures of a wind turbine. Wind turbines also are subject to frequent starting and stopping and loads.The traditional approach to the problem of designing a wind turbine that will survive inclement weather is to select a design that is very rigid and strong. In current technology wind turbines, the blade, hub and tower are rigid. The problem with this approach is that the resulting turbines are inefficient at low wind speeds, bulky, heavy, expensive, difficult to build and difficult to transport. The blades, blade roots, bearings, hubs and power transmission system are areas of particular concern.For large current-technology wind turbines, the gear sets and bearings are very large, with some gears being several feet in diameter. Such large gears can be produced by very few suppliers using very expensive, custom-built equipment. Large current-technology wind turbines cannot be easily transported by road due to the size and bulk of the components, particularly the tower and blades. Erection of such a turbine is a significant construction project requiring use of heavy equipment and large cranes.A horizontal up-wind wind turbine must include a yaw bearing connecting the nacelle to the tower to support the nacelle and turbine blades and to turn the axis of rotation, and hence the blades, into the wind. Current technology wind turbines utilize a single large-format yaw bearing located at the top of the tower. Because the turbine blades are very heavy and are supported by the nacelle at a distance from the yaw bearing, the local forces acting on the single yaw bearing are multiplied by the lever arm created by the nacelle. Current technology yaw bearing must be very large, strong, and expensive to support the resulting bending moments.Because the turbine blade rotates, the relative speed and hence relative direction between the turbine blade and the wind varies along the length of the blade from the root to the tip. The blade therefore must have a twist to achieve the optimum angle of attack of the rotating blade. Because of the size of the blades, the blades must be larger at the root end to provide adequate strength to support the resulting weight.The low-wind speed turbine designer is faced with conflicting design goals—design a turbine that efficiently extracts power from the wind in low wind conditions but that can also survive the loads, both steady and cyclic, imposed by inclement weather.The prior art does not teach the wind turbine of the Invention.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present Invention is a wind turbine electrical generator for use in low wind conditions, including areas of average wind speed of 6.4 meters/second at an elevation of 100 meters. The present Invention can be applied to the harvesting of wind power at any wind speed.The wind turbine of the Invention is of the horizontal upwind type, with a rotor rotating about a horizontal axis of rotation on the upwind side of a tower or of the horizontal downwind type, with the blades rotating about a horizontal axis of rotation on the downwind side of the tower. The tower supports a nacelle above the ground. The nacelle is connected to the tower through yaw bearings and a yaw drive system to allow the axis of rotation of the blades to be oriented into the wind. The nacelle houses an electrical generator that is connected to the hub of the rotor through a power transmission system. The power transmission system includes a speed increaser gear train to translate the 11 rpm design rotation speed of the rotor to the rotation requirements of the electrical generator (with a design speed of 1800 rpm).Folding Turbine BladePurposeThe rotor features turbine blades that fold and that may be moored to the tower during events of excess wind speed or other adverse weather conditions. Mooring the blade to the tower unloads the blade, blade root, hub and blade bearings, substantially reducing the force of the wind on those components. As a result, relatively lightweight and inexpensive hub, bearings, power transmission systems and blades may be used for a large wind turbine, substantially reducing the cost of the wind turbine and easing maintenance tasks.Structure of the Folding BladeThe rotor is composed of three sections of approximately equal length; namely, a hub beam and two turbine blades. The center of the hub beam is attached to the hub by a teetering hinge. A feathering hinge is attached to each end of the hub beam and a lag/fold hinge is integral to each feathering hinge. The turbine blades are attached to the opposing ends of the hub beam at the lag/fold hinges and extend radially about the teetering hinge so that the hub beam supports the blades in a spaced-apart relation about the teetering hinge. The turbine blades define a swept annular area as the rotor rotates about a low-speed shaft coincident with the teetering hinge. The wind passing through the annular area and encountering the turbine blades largely determines the power that can be harvested by the wind generator.The feathering hinge allows the blade to rotate about a feathering axis of rotation corresponding to the longitudinal dimension of the blade, allowing the angle of attack of the blade to be changed. The blade is rotated about the feathering hinge by a pair of hydraulic screw jacks or hydraulic pistons. The lag/fold hinge allows the blade to pivot with respect to the feathering hinge in a plane corresponding generally to the chord of the blade at the blade root. The chord is a straight line from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the blade. A hydraulic screw jack mounted between the blade and the feathering hinge rotates the blade about the lag/fold hinge. The feathering hinge in combination with the lag/fold hinge allows controlled movement of the turbine blades in three dimensions.A fabric strap, preferably composed of a para-aramid synthetic fiber, such as Kevlar® or Twaron®, is formed into a loop. The loop extends the length of the hub beam and is attached to both of the feathering hinges at either end of the hub beam. The fabric strap retains the feathering hinges, and hence the turbine blades, to the opposing ends of the hub beam. As the turbine rotates about the teetering hub, a portion of the weight of the blade that is below the horizontal with respect to the hub is transferred by the strap to the feathering hinge that is above the horizontal. The proportion of the weight transferred depends upon the rotational location of the rotor. When the rotor is in the vertical position, all of the weight of the lower turbine blade is supported by the upper feathering hinge. Because of the strap, the hub beam experiences the load presented by the weight of the blade as a compression load rather than a tension load. The connection between the hub beam and the feathering hinge therefore is not required to support the weight of the blade in tension.The centrifugal forces of the rotating blades are transferred from each blade to the other through the strap and are not seen by the hub beam. The use of the strap eliminates the need for a tension-type bearing connection between the hub beam and each feathering hinge that is capable of supporting the centrifugal force generated by the rotating blades.In the absence of the strap, the connection between the feathering hinge and the hub beam would be very heavy and robust to support the tension loads caused by the weight of the blades and caused by the centrifugal forces generated by the rotating blades. The strap relieves the hub beam of all such tension loads and allows the hub beam, feathering hinge and the connection between the hub beam and feathering hinge to be much lighter and less expensive than would otherwise be possible.First and Second PositionsThe turbine blades have a first, or deployed, position and a second, or moored, position. When in the deployed position, the blades are radially arrayed about the hub and configured for rotation in response to a wind passing through the annular area defined by the rotor. When in the moored position, the blades are folded about the pitch and lag/fold hinges and the free ends of the folded blades are connected to the tower. The lateral separation of the turbine blades from the hub by the hub beam permits no mechanical interference with the nacelle, tower or hub when the turbine blades are folded to the tower by the action of the feathering hinge and the lag/fold hinge in cooperation.ActuatorsActuators move the turbine blades between the first, or deployed position, and the second, or moored position. The actuators include an electrical engagement system, actuators to operate the feather hinge, actuators to operate the lag/fold hinge, the yaw motor, and mooring clamps to clamp the blades to the tower. When the control system issues a command to moor the turbine blades, the electrical engagement system disconnects the electrical generator from the electrical load powered by the generator. Feather hinge actuators feather the blades to stop the rotation of the rotor. The feather hinge actuators may be hydraulically or electrically operated. A brake/indexer holds the stopped rotor in position for mooring. The yaw motor rotates the nacelle about the yaw bearing to the position appropriate for mooring. A yaw sensor and a blade position sensor confirm that the hub beam is properly oriented for mooring. The feather hinge actuators orient the pitch of the blades about the feathering hinge (and hence the orientation of the lag/fold hinge) for mooring. The lag/fold hinge hydraulic screw jack then folds the blade to a position from which the blade can be mechanically secured to the tower. A cradle is attached to the tower and receives the turbine blade. A mooring clamp actuator mechanically clamps the blade to the cradle.Unmooring of the blades is a reversal of the mooring process. The mooring clamp releases the blades from the cradle. The lag/fold hinge hydraulic screw jack unfolds the blades to the first, or deployed, position in which the blade extends radially about the hub. The feathering hinge actuators adjust the pitch of the blades and the yaw motor moves the axis of rotation of the blades into the wind. The brake/indexer is released, allowing the blades, transmission and generator to rotate. The electrical engagement system places the generator back on line, generating electrical power.Teetering HingeThe hub of the rotor includes a teetering hinge that allows teetering motion of the blades normal to the plane of rotation of the rotor. As one blade moves in the downwind direction, the other blade moves in the upwind direction. The teetering, or flapping, motion is damped by dampers that may be elastomeric or hydraulic and by the mass of the rotating blades. The teetering hub allows the blades to absorb a portion of the cyclical and varying forces on the blades, reducing the stress on the blades and reducing the required strength and weight of the blades, blade root and blade hub.Hub BeamThe hub beam serves several purposes. First, the length of the hub beam and the two blades are selected to be approximately 127 feet, so that the hub beam and the blades can be transported readily over the road by truck, while providing a wind turbine with a total blade diameter of approximately 400 feet.Second, mounting the blade at either end of the hub beam places the feathering hinge and lag/fold hinge at a distance from the nacelle defined by generally one-half of the length of the hub beam. The spaced-apart relation of the hub and the feathering and lag/fold hinges provides the mechanical clearance so that the blades may be folded to the tower without interfering with the nacelle.Third, the power capable of being generated by the wind turbine is determined by the annular area swept by a revolution of the blade. Increasing the outside diameter of the annulus swept by the blade increases the swept annular area by more than decreasing the inside diameter swept by the blade. Structural and aerodynamic considerations require that the inner portion of the blade have a larger chord and thickness than the outer portion of the blade. The inner portion of any turbine blade is relatively heavy and expensive to manufacture compared to the outer portion of the blade, while providing comparatively little benefit in terms of power production.Fourth, the use of a hub beam moves the portion of the turbine blade that may ‘cone’ in response to the force of the wind further out on the radius of the turbine. ‘Coning’ is the tendency of a wind turbine blade to deform in response to the wind and to take on a cone-like shape. Excessive coning can cause a turbine blade of a horizontal upwind type to physically strike the tower, damaging both the blade and the tower. Use of the hub beam moves the deforming portion of the rotor away from the hub and reduces the required stiffness of the blade while reducing the likelihood of tower strikes by the rotating blade.Control SystemThe purpose of the control system is to instruct the actuators whether to maintain the turbine blades in the first (deployed) or second (moored) position and whether to move the turbine blades between the first and second positions. The purpose of the control system also is to determine optimal settings and sequence for each actuator for efficient operation of the wind turbine.The control system includes at least one weather sensor. The weather sensor is configured to detect a weather condition. The detected weather condition may include wind speed, barometric pressure, temperature or humidity. The weather sensor may be a Doppler radar or a wind profiler to detect air movement or differences in air movement, or may be any other weather sensor that provides useful information to the control system. The weather sensors available to the control system may include a weather satellite, either alone or in combination with other sensors. The weather sensor may be one of a plurality of weather sensors and the detected weather condition may be one of a plurality of weather conditions. The weather sensor may be operated by a commercial or government weather forecasting or reporting service. The weather sensors may be located remotely from the wind turbine.The control system includes a microprocessor and computer memory accessible by the microprocessor. The microprocessor is configured to be in communication with the weather sensor and with the actuators. The computer memory stores a control rule. The microprocessor continually compares the weather conditions detected by the weather sensors to the control rule and determines whether the turbine blades should be moved between the first and second positions. The control rule is selected to detect or predict wind speeds and turbulence at the wind turbine that may exceed the normal operating loads for the wind turbine. The control rule will utilize the detected or predicted wind speeds and turbulence to prevent conditions in which the turbine blades may be exposed to forces that could exceed the design or other operating limits of the turbine blade, blade root, hub, bearings power transmission system, tower, or any other component of the wind power generator.For example, the weather sensor may be an anemometer and the weather condition detected may be wind speed. The control rule is designed such that if a measured wind speed is detected by one or more anemometers in an anemometer array that is a predetermined percentage of the maximum design wind speed of the wind power generator, then the control system will command the actuators to move the turbine blade from the first, or deployed, position to the second, or moored, position.As a second example, weather sensors may be a thermometer measuring temperature and a hygrometer measuring humidity. The control rule may be selected to determine whether the measured temperature and humidity indicate that an unacceptable danger of icing exists. The microprocessor compares the measured temperature and humidity to the control rule to determine if the probability of icing is unacceptable. If the microprocessor determines that an unacceptable likelihood of icing does exist, the microprocessor will cause the control system to direct the mooring actuators to move the turbine blades from the first to the second position.As a third example, the weather sensor may be a radar, Ladar (laser radar), or sonar wind profiler or Doppler radar configured to detect air movement. The microprocessor compares the data collected to the control rule and determines whether wind conditions or gradients are dangerous to the wind turbine. If the microprocessor so determines, the control system will direct the mooring actuators to move the turbine blade from the first to the second position.As a fourth example, the weather sensor may be a satellite recording optical or other images. The weather sensors may be operated by any person, including a commercial or government weather service. The microprocessor may receive a weather prediction or caution from the commercial or government weather service based on data from the satellite weather sensor and other weather sensors. If the microprocessor determines that the predicted weather condition may exceed an operational limitation of the wind turbine, the microprocessor may command the control system and actuators to move the turbine blades from the first to the second position.Time is required for the actuators to complete the task of taking the electrical generator off line, slowing the rotating turbine blades to a stop, correctly orienting the turbine blades with respect to the tower, folding the turbine blades and mooring the turbine blades to the cradles attached to the tower. If the weather sensor is located on the tower or too close to the tower, the weather sensor may identify a weather condition dangerous to the wind generator only after the dangerous condition occurs. The weather sensor or sensors preferably are located at a sufficient distance from the tower to allow the control system to react to a detected weather condition prior to the time that the weather condition reaches the wind generator. Preferably, weather sensors are located at a plurality of locations remote from the tower and in a sufficient density to detect potentially dangerous local conditions such as thunderstorms, wind gusts, or micro-gusts.Wind turbines commonly are arrayed in wind farms comprising a plurality of wind turbines. A single control system may be utilized to control all of the wind turbines in a wind farm or in multiple wind farms. Conversely, each wind turbine may be equipped with a dedicated control system. A network of weather sensors may be deployed in the vicinity of a wind farm and the weather conditions detected by the network of weather sensors may be utilized by the microprocessor to control all or some of the turbines in a wind farm. The network of weather sensors may include weather sensors located remote from the wind turbine, such as weather sensors operated by commercial or government weather forecasters. The single control system may be under the control of a live human operator. The live human operator may override an automated command of the control system if the human operator determines that a control command different from that made by the control system is advisable.The control system also may control all aspects of the operation of the wind turbine. For example, the horizontal axis of rotation of the turbine blades must be oriented into the wind for efficient power production. The control system will monitor wind direction through the weather sensors and will instruct the yaw motor to adjust the yaw angle of the nacelle so that the axis of rotation of the turbine blades is directed into the wind.The control system also may receive feedback from the wind turbine in the form of information as to the operating condition of the wind turbine received from operating condition sensors. The operating conditions may include mechanical conditions of the wind turbine, such as the rotational speed of the rotor, the temperature of a bearing, electrical potential and electrical current produced by the electrical generator, or the temperature or lubrication status of the speed increaser. The monitored operating conditions also may include information verifying whether actuator commands have been properly implemented, such as the rotational location of the rotor, yaw angle, blade lag angle about the lag/fold hinge, feather angle about the feathering hinge and status of the clamp. The control system may consider the operating condition information received from condition sensors in conjunction with weather information received from weather sensors in determining whether to command the first or second position for the rotor and in determining optimal settings for each actuator for efficient wind turbine operation.The sensors may communicate with the control system and the control system may communicate with the mooring system by any convention means, including a wired connection, radio, cellular telephone technology, communication by visible light or other radiation, and by any other conventional means.Yaw BearingsThe yaw bearings of the Invention connect the nacelle to the tower and allow the horizontal axis of rotation of the turbine blades to rotate about the tower. The yaw bearings of the Invention comprise a first, or upper, yaw bearing and a second, or lower yaw bearing. The first yaw bearing is located at the top of the tower and between the nacelle and the tower. The second yaw bearing is circular in shape and is located about the tower in a spaced apart relation with the first yaw bearing. The second yaw bearing supports at least one strut. The strut is attached to the nacelle between the first yaw bearing and the turbine blade hub. The strut supports much of the weight of the rotor, hub, nacelle and associated structures.Use of the second yaw bearing allows a substantial portion of the weight of the blades, hub and nacelle to be supported as an axial load by the second, or lower, yaw bearing and avoids the extreme loading of the first yaw bearing due to the leverage of an off-center load.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1is a perspective view of the wind turbine of the Invention.FIG. 2is front view of the wind turbine in the first, or deployed, position.FIG. 3is a front view of the wind turbine in the second, or moored, position.FIG. 4is a detail perspective view of the yaw bearings, nacelle, cradle and clampsFIG. 5is a schematic diagram of the nacelle.FIG. 6is a detail cutaway view of the teetering hub.FIG. 7is a schematic side view of the apparatus showing the plane of rotation of the rotor.FIG. 8is a detail cutaway view of the hub beam.FIG. 9is an exploded view of the feathering and lag/fold hinges.FIG. 10is a perspective view of a turbine blade.FIG. 11is a section view of the hub beam.FIG. 12is a schematic diagram of the control system.FIG. 13is a schematic diagram of the actuators.FIG. 14is a schematic diagram of the power generation electrical system.FIG. 15is a schematic diagram of monitored weather conditions.FIG. 16is a schematic diagram of monitored operating conditions.FIG. 17is a schematic diagram of a plurality of wind generators operated by a single control system utilizing a plurality of weather condition monitoring locations.DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENTThe Invention is a wind turbine electrical generator for use in low wind conditions.As shown byFIGS. 1-3, the wind turbine of the Invention features atower2and awind turbine rotor4supported by thetower2above the surface of aground6. Thewind turbine rotor4has an axis ofrotation8and is of the horizontal upwind type; that is, the axis ofrotation8is generally horizontal with respect to the Earth and thewind turbine rotor4is located upwind oftower2. The Invention also may be applied to horizontal downwind-type wind turbines.Thewind turbine rotor4includesturbine blades12and is configured to rotate indirection9in response to awind10. Thewind turbine rotor4has a first position, illustrated byFIGS. 1 and 2, and a second position, illustrated byFIG. 3. In the first position, also referred to herein as the ‘deployed position,’wind turbine blades12are radially arrayed about ahub14and configured for rotation in response towind10. In the second position, also referred to herein as the ‘moored position,’wind turbine blades12are folded about amooring hinge16. The foldedturbine blades12are moored to acradle18that is attached totower2. The foldedturbine blades12are retained in thecradle18byclamps20.As shown byFIG. 4, the wind turbine includes anacelle22supported at the top oftower2by upper andlower yaw bearings24,26. Upper andlower yaw bearings24,26allownacelle22, and hence axis ofrotation8, to rotate about avertical yaw axis27. Rotation of nacelle onyaw bearings24,26aboutvertical yaw axis27allows axis ofrotation8to be directed into thewind10. Lower yaw bearing26is annular and is arrayed aroundtower2between theground6andupper yaw bearing24. A pair ofstruts38attaches thelower yaw bearing26and thenacelle22between upper yaw bearing24androtor4.Struts38transfer a portion of the load imposed byrotor4,hub14andnacelle22to thelower yaw bearing26.Struts38andlower yaw bearing26relieve upper yaw bearing24of the very high local loads resulting from the cantilevered weight of therotor4,nacelle22, and associated structures.Cradle18, shown byFIGS. 2,3and4, receivesblades12when theblades12move from the first position to the second position.Clamp20securesblades12withincradle18.Clamp20has a released position illustrated byFIG. 4and a clamped position illustrated byFIG. 3. In the clamped position, theclamp20securesblades12withincradle18. In the released position, clamps20do not engageblades12. In the released position,blades12are supported bycradle18but are not secured to cradle18.As shown schematically byFIG. 5,rotor4turns a low-speed shaft28contained withinnacelle22. Low-speed shaft28rotates at a design speed of 11 rpm and turns an input ofspeed increaser30.Speed increaser30is a gear train that translates the low speed rotation of the low-speed shaft28to a high speed rotation of a high speed shaft32. High speed shaft32is connected to anelectrical generator34, which transforms the rotational energy of therotor2into electrical energy. Conventional slip ring connectors connect the output124(FIG. 14) of theelectrical generator34to anelectrical load126. A brake/indexer36allows therotor4to be stopped for mooring. Thespeed increaser30and brake/indexer36generate substantial torque loads on thenacelle22and hencetower2. Thespeed increaser30and brake/indexer36are located innacelle22as close to the upper yaw bearing24as possible, thereby reducing torsional loads onnacelle22as much as possible.Therotor4illustrated byFIGS. 1,2and3is composed of three principal components—twoturbine blades12and thehub beam40.Hub beam40and eachblade12are approximately of equal length. A design length of 127 feet will allow thehub beam40andblades12to be transported by truck without limitation while allowing an assembledrotor4of approximately 400 feet in diameter.FIGS. 6 through 8illustrate thehub beam40. Thehub beam40is a structural member that holds theturbine blades12in a spaced apart relation with respect tohub14.FIG. 6is a partial cutaway view ofhub14. Thehub14comprises a teeteringhinge42and is disposed at approximately the midpoint along the longitudinal dimension of thehub beam40. Teeteringhinge42is defined by abarrel nut44joining low-speed shaft28andbracket46.Bracket46is rigidly attached tohub beam40. Teeteringhinge42is located on theupwind side48of and in a spaced apart relation tohub beam40. The motion ofhub beam40andblades12about the teeteringhinge42is damped bydampers47that may be elastomeric or hydraulic.As shown byFIGS. 6 and 7, teeteringhinge42allowsrotor4to ‘flap;’ that is, to move in a direction normal to theplane50swept by therotating rotor4. The direction of allowable movement is illustrated by arrows54onFIG. 7. Theteeter angle134ofFIG. 6is the angular difference between aplane50normal to the axis ofrotation8and the actual angular location ofrotor4with respect to the axis ofrotation8. The limits ofallowable teeter angle134are illustrated by the dashed lines ofFIG. 7. Teeteringhinge42allows therotor4to react to wind gusts and uneven forces acting on therotor4as it rotates. The motion of therotor4about the teeteringhinge42is dampened bydampers47and by the mass of therotating rotor4. The flapping motion ofrotor4about teeteringhinge42spreads out and hence reduces the peak wind forces acting on theblades12,hub beam40,hub14,nacelle22and associated structures.Thehub beam40is illustrated byFIGS. 8 and 9.Brackets46are attached to thehub beam40at its longitudinal center.Hub beam40has two opposing ends56. One of theturbine blades12is attached to eachend56of thehub beam40. The purpose of thehub beam40is to support theturbine blades12in a spaced apart relation about the axis ofrotation8of therotor4.Thehub beam40is shaped to reduce wind resistance to its rotation.Hub beam40does not provide significant lift and the force of thewind10against thehub beam40does not add significantly to the power generated by theturbine blades12.Thehub beam end56is attached to the twoturbine blades12by amooring hinge16.Mooring hinge16comprises a featheringhinge58and a lag/fold hinge60, illustrated by the exploded view ofFIG. 10. Featheringhinge58includes afemale portion62affixed to theend56ofhub beam40. Featheringhinge58also includes amating male portion64that rotatably engagesfemale portion62. Featheringhinge58allowsblade12to rotate about a bladelongitudinal dimension68of theblade12, as shown byFIG. 10, to change thefeather angle132of theturbine blade12, allowing the pitch or the angle of attack of therotating blade12to be controlled. The bladelongitudinal dimension68runs generally along a center of lift from theblade root70to theblade tip72. A pair of hydraulic screw jacks is arrayed at theend56ofhub beam40and attach the female62and male64portions of featheringhinge58and control thefeather angle132of the featheringhinge58and hence theblade12.Lag/foldhinge60is a pin connection betweenblade12andmale portion64of featheringhinge58. Lag/foldhinge60allowsblade12to pivot in a plane generally coextensive with thechord76ofblade12to select alag angle74. Thechord76generally is a line from the leadingedge78to the trailingedge80ofblade12. A lag/fold effector116in the form of a hydraulic screw jack joins thewing root70and themale portion64of the featheringhinge58, controlling thelag angle74of the turbine blade with respect to thehub beam40.Hub beam40features a pair of opposing hub beam ends56, to which a pair of opposing feathering hinges58and a pair of lag/fold hinges60are attached. A pair ofblades12is supported by the opposing lag/fold hinges60.FIG. 11is a cross section of thehub beam40. The two opposingfemale portions62of opposing feathering hinges58are joined one to the other by astrap82.Strap82preferably is formed in aloop83and composed of a para-aramidsynthetic fiber81, such as Kevlar®. Thestrap82extends the length of thehub beam40, joining onefemale portion62to the otherfemale portion62. Thestrap82extends around thebracket46andlow speed shaft28. Thestrap82supports a portion of the weight of theblade12that is below the horizontal. When therotor4is oriented vertically, which occurs twice for each revolution ofblade12, thestrap82supports the entire weight of theblade12that is closer to theground6. Thestrap82also supports the centrifugal forces creating by therotating blades12.Use ofstrap82eliminates the need for a connection between thefemale portion62of featheringhinge58and theend56ofhub beam40that will support the weight of theturbine blade12and the centrifugal force generated by therotating blades12in tension. Use of thestrap82transfers what would otherwise be a tension load on theend56of thehub beam40into a compression load on the opposingend56of thehub beam40. The compression load is easier for thehub beam40to support, allowing alighter hub beam40andfemale portion62than would otherwise be possible.Use ofhub beam40combined with featheringhinge58and lag/fold hinge60allowsblades12to be moored totower2. The plane of rotation50(FIG. 7), defined by the sweep of therotating blades12, is in a spaced-apart relation to thetower2and upwind of thetower2. The spaced-apart relation between the plane ofrotation50and thetower2is necessary to prevent a strike by ablade12against thetower2due to ‘coning’ of theblades12; that is, due to deformation of theblades12in the downwind direction due to the force of thewind10on theblades12. To moor to thetower2, theblades12must traverse the space between the plane ofrotation50and thecradle18on thetower2. Thehub beam40physically separates the feathering and lag/fold hinges60,62from thenacelle22, preventing mechanical interference between thefolding blades12and thenacelle22. Placing theblades12at theends56of thehub beam40also reduces the length of theblade12subject to significant coning, allowing theblades12to be lighter and more flexible than would otherwise be possible. Finally, use of the feathering and lag/fold hinges60,62in combination allows theblades12to move in three dimensions so that theblades12can traverse the distance between the plane ofrotation50and thetower2.Use of thehub beam40also allows therotor4to be more efficient in a low speed wind than would otherwise be possible. Theblade12defines an annulus as it rotates. The larger the diameter of therotor4, the more wind energy that can be captured by the wind turbine; however, the longer theblade12, the heavier and more difficult and expensive to make, transport and operate theblade12becomes. The use of thehub beam40allows a large and efficient turbine to be constructed with relatively short, light andinexpensive blades12.Control SystemThecontrol system85to operate the wind turbine is shown schematically byFIGS. 12-17. During the operation of the wind turbine to generate electrical power, thecontrol system85regulates thefeather angle132of theturbine blades12, thelag angle74of theblades12, and theyaw136of thenacelle22to efficiently extract power from theincident wind10while preventing an over-speed condition of therotor4, excessive vibration, or other operating condition that exceeds an operating parameter of the wind turbine. If thecontrol system85or a human operator determines that an operating limitation of the turbine may be exceeded, thecontrol system85will cause theturbine blades12to be stopped, folded and moored to thetower2, preserving the wind turbine from damage.Thecontrol system85includes amicroprocessor84. Acomputer memory86is accessible to the microprocessor and stores acontrol rule88, which also is accessible tomicroprocessor84. At least oneweather sensor90is operably connected to themicroprocessor84.Weather sensor90is selected to detect aweather condition87. As illustrated byFIG. 15, the detectedweather condition87can be any or all ofwind direction93,wind speed95, wind profile96, air temperature98,humidity100,barometric pressure102, the return of aradar transmission104or aweather prediction106from a human or automated weather forecaster.Wind direction93is necessary so that thecontrol system85can orient thenacelle22inyaw136and hence point the axis ofrotation8intowind10.Wind direction93may be measured by many vanes located in the vicinity of thewind turbine2.Wind speed95is necessary to select theappropriate feather angle132and henceblade pitch114to extract power efficiently.Wind speed95also is necessary to determine whether an event ofexcess rotor speed128or excess forces on therotor4is likely to occur, requiring that theblades12be moved to the second position. Wind profile96is the differences in wind speed and direction at different altitudes and may be determined by radar or sonar wind profilers. Since wind turbines for commercial power generation are large, the wind speeds95anddirection93that will encounter the top of therotor4may be different from those that encounter the bottom of therotor4. The wind profile96may be considered by thecontrol system85in determining whether to deploy or fold theblades12and in selectingfeather angle132,lag angle130andyaw136. Temperature98andhumidity100can be useful to thecontrol system85to predict whether unacceptable icing conditions may occur at therotor4. If the risk of icing is unacceptable, thecontrol system85may determine to moveblades12to the second position.Barometric pressure102may be used in conjunction with other parameters, for example temperature98,humidity100,wind speed95,wind direction93to predictweather conditions87at therotor4in the future, and hence whetherblades12should be moved to or maintained in the first or second position.Themicroprocessor84also may receive aweather prediction106made by a human meteorologist or by an automated forecasting system and the microprocessor may determine whether to move therotor4between the first and second positions based on thatprediction106. For example, the operator of the wind turbine may subscribe to a weather forecasting service and may base a decision on the providedweather prediction106.Weather sensors90may be operated by any person, including the National Weather Service or a third party provider of weather forecasting.Ahuman interface94, such as a conventional display, keyboard and mouse, is in communication with themicroprocessor84and allows a human operator to monitor the operation of thecontrol system85and to issue an instruction97if the human operator concludes that a choice better than that made by theautomated control system85is desirable.For all of the monitoredweather conditions87,computer memory86may storeweather conditions87data of the recent past for the purpose of predictingfuture weather conditions87and may determine whether to move or maintain theblades12in the first or second position based on thecurrent weather conditions87compared withweather conditions87of the past.When thecontrol system85or a human operator determines that therotor4should move between the first (deployed) and the second (moored) positions, themicroprocessor84will issue a moor orunmoor command108toactuator110. As shown byFIG. 13,actuator110comprises a series of effectors that cooperate to move therotor4between the moored and unmoored position. Those effectors include ayaw motor112that controls theyaw136of thenacelle22, and hence the orientation of the axis ofrotation8.Yaw motor112is necessary to point therotor4into thewind10and also to orientrotor4for mooring.Effectors also include hydraulic screw jacks located at theends56of thehub beam40and controlling theblade pitch114, also referred to asfeather angle132, about the featheringhinge58. Control of thefeather angle132is necessary to select an appropriate angle of attack forblade12whenblade12is in the first position and generating power. Control of thefeather angle132also is necessary to stop and start therotor4and to allow the three dimensional movement ofblade12between the first and second positions.Blade lag/foldeffectors116are hydraulic screw jacks that control the angular position of theblade12about the lag/fold hinge60, also referred to aslag angle74, within the plane corresponding tochord76ofblade root70. Blade lag/foldeffectors116also are necessary to allow three dimensional movement ofblade12between the moored and unmoored positions.Brake/indexer36is attached to the low-speed shaft28and allows therotor4to be secured for mooring. Brake/indexer36also holdshub beam40, and hencerotor4, in a stationary position whenblades12are in the second position.FIG. 14is an electrical block diagram. FromFIG. 14,electrical generator34has anoutput124of electrical power that is connected to the conventional electrical grid through theelectrical engagement system122, which also is conventional. Thegenerator34supplieselectrical load126.Electrical engagement system122takeselectrical generator34off line whenrotor4is to be stopped or ifrotor4is not generating adequate electrical power due tolow wind10or other conditions. When theelectrical engagement system122takes theelectrical generator34off-line,electrical generator34is electrically separated from the utility power supply grid and theelectrical load126is removed fromgenerator34. When thegenerator34can be re-connected to the grid, such as when thewind10speed is sufficiently high and therotor4is turning at a sufficient rate, theelectrical engagement system122will synchronize thegenerator34and the grid and electrically connect thegenerator34to theload126.Thecontrol system85also responds to the operatingconditions99of the wind generator as detected by condition sensors92(FIG. 12) in determining whether theblades12should be in the first or the second positions. Thecondition sensors92provide feedback to thecontrol system85and provide actual information as to the status of therotor4,generator34,speed increaser30and other components of the wind turbine. Theconditions sensors92are operably connected to themicroprocessor84. Thosecondition sensors92may include any parameter found useful in governing the wind turbine and may be selected from at least the following list, as shown byFIG. 16:rotor speed128,lag angle130,feather angle132,teeter angle134,yaw136ofnacelle22, rotational location ofrotor138,speed increaser temperature142, speed increaser lubrication status144, bearingtemperature146,rotor vibration status148,clamp status150andpower generation status152.Rotor speed128is the angular speed of therotor4about the axis ofrotation8and is controlled by thecontrol system85through selection of thefeather angle132,lag angle74andyaw136. Thecontrol system85will select those parameters to maintain a design rotor speed of 11 rpm.Lag angle130,feather angle132andyaw136may be monitored to verify that commanded values for those parameters actually are implemented by the control effectors and that the values are proper for mooring of theblades12.Teeter angle134may be monitored as a measure of the differential forces of thewind10acting on therotor4in different portions of its rotation. The rotational location ofrotor138may be monitored during mooring and unmooring to ensure that thehub beam40and henceblades12are in the proper position for mooring.Thecontrol system85may monitoroperating conditions99comprising various mechanical parameters to avoid mechanical failures, such asspeed increaser temperature142and lubrication status144or abearing temperature146. If thespeed increaser30or a bearing is running at higher-than-expected temperatures, the speed increaser39or bearing may be in the process of failing and thecontrol system85may reduce the power generated by the turbine or may elect to move theblades12to the second position until repairs can be effected. If the lubrication status144of thespeed increaser30indicates that thespeed increaser30is operating without sufficient lubrication, thecontrol system85may determine to move theblades12to the second position to avoid damage to thespeed increaser30.Thecontrol system85may monitor thevibration status148of therotor4; namely, therotor4vibration frequency, amplitude, or both. Thecontrol system85may command steps to control vibration, such as changing thefeather angle58,lag angle60,yaw angle136, or by directing therotor4to move to the second position.Thecontrol system85may monitor theclamp status150ofclamp20; namely, whetherclamp20is in the clamped position or the released position, to verify that theblade12is in fact moored after amooring command108is issued by thecontrol system85and to verify that theclamp20is released when an unmooringcommand108is issued. Thepower generation status152will advise thecontrol system85of electrical potential and power generated to verify optimal operation of the turbine. Should thecontrol system85detect anoperating condition99that indicates out-of-tolerance performance by any operating system, thecontrol system85can take corrective action by an appropriate command to anyactuator110or can direct therotor2into the second position, shutting down and preserving the wind turbine until inspection and repair can be effected.As shown byFIG. 17, eachweather sensor90is located at aweather sensor location154. Asingle control system85may receive information onweather conditions87from a plurality ofweather sensors90located in a plurality of differentweather sensor locations154.Weather sensor locations154may be remote from towers2. Thesingle control system85also may receive information on operatingconditions99at each of the plurality of wind generators from a plurality ofcondition sensors92located at each wind generator.Using thecontrol system85, a single human operator located in a distant city can control the operation of multiple wind farms each comprising many wind turbines located in distant and remote locations using information onweather conditions87collected by local, regional andnational weather sensors90, including weather satellites. Theautomated control system85can determine the operating parameters of each actuator110for each turbine based on theweather conditions87detected and predicted for the location of the turbine and based upon operatingconditions99of the turbine. If thecontrol system85detects or predicts aweather condition87or anoperating condition99that may exceed any operating parameter for a turbine, the control system may issue or maintain amooring command108directing theactuators110for that turbine to move to or maintain therotor4of the turbine in the second position. If the human operator concludes that thecommand108of thecontrol system85is inappropriate, the human operator can instruct97thecontrol system85to issue adifferent command108.LIST OF CLAIM ELEMENTSThe following is a list of elements from the Claims including the element numbers assigned to each of the elements as described in the Specification and shown by the drawings.

       "  'description': 'CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/551,884, filed Oct. 23, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to wind turbines, and more specifically to methods and apparatus for controlling operation of a wind turbine.Generally, a wind turbine includes a rotor having multiple blades. The rotor is sometimes mounted within a housing, or nacelle, that is positioned on top of a base, for example a truss or tubular tower. At least some known electric utility grade wind turbines (i.e., wind turbines designed to provide electrical power to an electric utility grid) can have rotors of 30 meters (m) (98 feet (ft)) or more in diameter. The rotor blades transform mechanical wind energy into a mechanical rotational torque that drives one or more generators. The generators are sometimes, but not always, rotationally coupled to the rotor through a gearbox. The gearbox steps up the inherently low rotational speed of the turbine rotor for the generator to efficiently convert the rotational mechanical energy to electrical energy, which is fed into the electric utility grid. Gearless direct drive wind turbine generators also exist.Seasonal changes to the ambient air conditions, for example changes to ambient air temperature and/or pressure, may affect performance of at least some known wind turbines. For example, the normal international engineering code (IEC) design envelope of a wind turbine defines loads acting on the wind energy turbine within a temperature range from about +40 degrees Celsius (° C.) (about 100 degrees Fahrenheit (° F.)) to about −20° C. (about −30° F.). Operation of a wind turbine below this temperature range may require new load calculations which will exceed the design load envelope if no countermeasures are taken, possibly resulting in the need of new, reinforced components. At least some known wind turbines, when subjected to cold weather conditions with ambient air temperature values below the lower temperature limit of the allowable temperature range, are shut off, which is disadvantageous insofar as no electric output power is generated.Another example of seasonal changes affecting wind turbine performance is that air temperature-corrected turbine performance of at least some known wind turbines may be lower in the summer than in the winter. For example, a probability of the rotor blades of at least some known wind turbines to stall increases during summer conditions when ambient air temperatures are typically higher. Such stalling reduces a potential electric power output of the wind turbine. Moreover, reestablishment of airflow around at least some known wind turbine rotor blades after stalling may cause a short-term increase in generator speed and/or electric power output that may be difficult for a controller of the wind turbine to process. Such controller processing difficulty may increase a probability of the wind turbine to be disconnected from an electric grid due to over-speed and/or over-production conditions.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONIn one aspect, a method for operating a wind turbine.

As used herein, the term “wind turbine” is intended to be representative of any device that generates rotational energy from wind energy, and more specifically, converts kinetic energy of wind into mechanical energy. As used herein, the term “wind turbine generator” is intended to be representative of any wind turbine that generates electrical power from rotational energy generated from wind energy, and more specifically, converts mechanical energy converted from kinetic energy of wind to electrical power. As used herein, the term “windmill” is intended to be representative of any wind turbine that uses rotational energy generated from wind energy, and more specifically mechanical energy converted from kinetic energy of wind, for a predetermined purpose other than generating electrical power, such as, but not limited to, pumping a fluid and/or grinding a substance.FIG. 1is a schematic view anexemplary wind turbine10.FIG. 2is a schematic view of anexemplary nacelle16that may be used with wind turbine10(shown inFIG. 1).FIG. 3is an electrical and electronic schematic diagram of wind turbine10(shown inFIG. 1).Wind turbine10described and illustrated herein is a wind generator for generating electrical power from wind energy. However, in some embodiments,wind turbine10may be, in addition or alternative to a wind generator, any type of wind turbine, such as, but not limited to, a windmill (not shown). Moreover,wind turbine10described and illustrated herein includes a horizontal-axis configuration. However, in some embodiments,wind turbine10may include, in addition or alternative to the horizontal-axis configuration, a vertical-axis configuration (not shown).Wind turbine10may be coupled to an electrical load (not shown), such as, but not limited to, a power grid (not shown), for receiving electrical power therefrom to drive operation ofwind turbine10and/or its associated components and/or for supplying electrical power generated bywind turbine10thereto. Although only onewind turbine10is shown inFIG. 1-3, in some embodiments a plurality ofwind turbines10may be grouped together, sometimes referred to as a “wind farm”.Wind turbine10includes abody16, sometimes referred to as a “nacelle”, and a rotor (generally designated by18) coupled tobody16for rotation with respect tobody16about an axis ofrotation20. In the exemplary embodiment,nacelle16is mounted on atower14. However, in some embodiments, in addition or alternative to tower-mountednacelle16,wind turbine10includes anacelle16adjacent the ground and/or a surface of water. The height oftower14may be any suitable height enablingwind turbine10to function as described herein.Rotor18includes ahub22and a plurality of blades24(sometimes referred to as “airfoils”) extending radially outwardly fromhub22for converting wind energy into rotational energy. Althoughrotor18is described and illustrated herein as having threeblades24,rotor18may have any number ofblades24.Blades24may each have any length (whether described herein). For example, in some embodiments one ormore rotor blades24are about 0.5 meters (m) (1.64 feet (ft)) long, while in some embodiments one ormore rotor blades24are about 50 m (164 ft) long. Other examples ofblade24lengths include 10 m (32.8 ft) or less, about 20 m (65.6 ft), about 37 m (121.4 ft), and about 40 m (131.2 ft). Still other examples include rotor blades between about 50 and about 100 meters long (164 ft to 328 ft).Despite howrotor blades24are illustrated inFIG. 1,rotor18may haveblades24of any shape, and may haveblades24of any type and/or any configuration, whether such shape, type, and/or configuration is described and/or illustrated herein. One example of another type, shape, and/or configuration ofrotor blades24is a ducted rotor (not shown) having a turbine (not shown) contained within a duct (not shown). Another example of another type, shape, and/or configuration ofrotor blades24is a darrieus wind turbine, sometimes referred to as an “eggbeater” turbine. Yet another example of another type, shape, and/or configuration ofrotor blades24is a savonious wind turbine. Even another example of another type, shape, and/or configuration ofrotor blades24is a traditional windmill for pumping water, such as, but not limited to, four-bladed rotors having wooden shutters and/or fabric sails. Moreover,wind turbine10may, in some embodiments, be a wind turbine whereinrotor18generally faces upwind to harness wind energy, and/or may be a wind turbine whereinrotor18generally faces downwind to harness energy. Of course, in any embodiments,rotor18may not face exactly upwind and/or downwind, but may face generally at any angle (which may be variable) with respect to a direction of the wind to harness energy therefrom.Referring now toFIGS. 2 and 3,wind turbine10includes anelectrical generator26coupled torotor18for generating electrical power from the rotational energy generated byrotor18. In the exemplary embodiment,generator26is a round rotor, synchronous, three-phase, permanent magnet generator that includes agenerator rotor25and astator27. However,generator26may be any type of generator including, but not limited to, salient pole generators, double-sided stator generators, and/or doubly-fed induction generators. In the exemplary embodiment,generator rotor25includes a plurality ofpermanent magnets29that are coupled togenerator rotor25. Alternatively,generator rotor25may be a wound rotor wherein the associated windings (neither shown) are separately-excited, for example, but not limited to, a salient-pole rotor.Generator rotor25andstator27are positioned such that a clearance gap31(sometimes referred to as an air gap) is defined betweenstator27andgenerator rotor25with a predetermined clearance gap radial dimension (not shown).Permanent magnets29with predetermined polarities are positioned to generate a magnetic field (not shown) aroundgenerator rotor25with a predetermined number of poles and a predetermined magnetic strength.Stator27includes a plurality of stator windings (not shown).Gap31facilitates magnetic coupling ofgenerator rotor25andstator27to generate a predetermined voltage withinstator27at a predetermined frequency that is determined bygenerator rotor25rotational speed asgenerator rotor25is rotated withinstator27. The generated voltages withinstator27subsequently generate a predetermined electric current withinstator27. The electric currents generated withinstator27subsequently generate a plurality of magnetic fields and as the magnetic field generated ingenerator rotor25rotates, the magnetic field ofgenerator rotor25interacts with the magnetic fields ofstator27throughgap31. The interaction of the magnetic fields induces magnetomotive axial and radial forces and a torque that act ongenerator rotor25. The radial and axial forces and torque induced ongenerator rotor25by the interaction of the magnetic fields are proportional to the strength and position of the magnetic flux component withingap31. As the flux component ingap31increases, the radial and axial forces and torque induced ongenerator rotor25increase. Similarly, as the flux component ingap31decreases, the radial and axial forces and torque induced ongenerator rotor25decrease. Therefore, modulating the flux modulates the radial and axial forces and torque induced ongenerator rotor25.Rotor18includes arotor shaft30coupled torotor hub22for rotation therewith.Generator26is coupled torotor shaft30such that rotation ofrotor shaft30drives rotation ofgenerator rotor25, and therefore facilitates operation ofgenerator26. In the exemplary embodiment,generator rotor25includes arotor shaft28rotatingly coupled thereto and rotatingly coupled torotor shaft30such that rotation ofrotor shaft30drives rotation ofgenerator rotor25. In other embodiments,generator rotor25is directly rotatably coupled torotor shaft30, sometimes referred to as a “direct-drive wind turbine”. In the exemplary embodiment,generator rotor shaft28is rotatably coupled torotor shaft30through agearbox32, although in other embodimentsgenerator rotor shaft28is rotatably coupled directly torotor shaft30. More specifically, in theexemplary embodiment gearbox32has alow speed side34rotatably coupled torotor shaft30and ahigh speed side36rotatably coupled togenerator rotor shaft28. The torque ofrotor18drives generator rotor25to thereby generate variable frequency AC electrical power from rotation ofrotor18. Afrequency converter38is electrically coupled togenerator26for converting the variable frequency AC to a fixed frequency AC for delivery to anelectrical utility grid39.Frequency converter38may be located anywhere within or remote towind turbine10. For example, in the exemplary embodiment,frequency converter38is located within a base (not shown) oftower14.In some embodiments,wind turbine10may include at least onecontrol system40coupled to at least one of the components ofwind turbine10for generally controlling operation ofwind turbine10and/or as some or all of the components thereof (whether such components are described and/or illustrated herein). In the exemplary embodiment,control system40is mounted withinnacelle16. However, additionally or alternatively,control system40may be remote fromnacelle16and/or other components ofwind turbine10.Control system40may be used for, but is not limited to, overall system monitoring and control including, for example, pitch and speed regulation, high-speed shaft and yaw brake application, yaw and pump motor application, and/or fault monitoring.

Furthermore, in some embodiments,wind turbine10may include ayaw system42for rotatingnacelle16about an axis ofrotation44for changing a yaw ofrotor18, and more specifically for changing a direction faced byrotor18to, for example, adjust an angle between the direction faced byrotor18and a direction of wind.Yaw system42may be coupled in electronic data communication to controlsystem40for control thereby.In some embodiments,wind turbine10may includeanemometry46for measuring wind speed and/or wind direction.Anemometry46, in some embodiments, may be coupled in electronic data communication to controlsystem40for sending measurements to controlsystem40for processing thereof. For example, and althoughanemometry46may be coupled in electronic data communication to controlsystem40for sending measurements thereto for controlling other operations ofwind turbine10,anemometry46may send measurements to controlsystem40for controlling and/or changing a yaw ofrotor18usingyaw system42. Alternatively,anemometry46may be coupled in electronic data communication directly toyaw system42for controlling and/or changing a yaw ofrotor18.Wind turbine10may also include a plurality ofsensors48, each coupled to acorresponding blade24for measuring a pitch of eachblade24, or more specifically an angle of eachblade24with respect to a wind direction and/or with respect torotor hub22.Sensors48may be any suitable sensor having any suitable location within or remote towind turbine10, such as, but not limited to, optical encoders within pitch system62(described below). In some embodiments,sensors48are coupled in electronic data communication to controlsystem40for sending pitch measurements to controlsystem40for processing thereof.In some embodiments,wind turbine10includes at least onesensor50coupled torotor shaft30for measuring a speed of rotation ofrotor shaft30and/or a torque ofrotor shaft30.Sensor50may be any suitable sensor having any suitable location within or remote towind turbine10, such as, but not limited to, optical encoders, digital proximity sensors, piezo-electric transducers, strain gages, and/or tachometers.

In some embodiments,sensor58is coupled in electronic data communication to controlsystem40for sending gap flux and/or generator rotor torque measurements to controlsystem40for processing thereof.In some embodiments,wind turbine10includes at least onesensor60configured to measure ambient air humidity.Sensor60may be any suitable sensor having any suitable location within or remote towind turbine10, such as, but not limited to, electronic relative humidity sensors. In some embodiments,sensor60is coupled in electronic data communication to controlsystem40for sending ambient air humidity measurements to controlsystem40for processing thereof.Wind turbine10may also include one or more other sensors (not shown) coupled to one or more components ofwind turbine10and/or the electrical load, whether such component(s) are described or illustrated herein, for measuring parameters of such component(s) and/or for measuring other ambient conditions. Such other sensor(s) may include, but are not limited to, sensors configured to measure any ambient condition, any operational parameter of any wind turbine component, displacement, yaw, pitch, moments, strain, stress, twist, damage, failure, rotor torque, rotor speed, an anomaly in the electrical load, and/or an anomaly of power supplied to any component ofwind turbine10. Such other sensors may couple to any component ofwind turbine10and/or the electrical load at any location thereof for measuring any parameter thereof, whether such component, location, and/or parameter is described and/or illustrated herein, and may be used to derive other measurements, e.g., viscosity, as known in the art.Wind turbine10includes a variableblade pitch system62for controlling, including but not limited to changing, a pitch angle ofrotor blades24with respect to a wind direction.Pitch system62may be coupled to controlsystem40for control thereby.Pitch system62includes one or more actuators (not shown) coupled tohub22andblades24for changing the pitch angle ofblades24by rotatingblades24with respect tohub22. The pitch actuators may include any suitable structure, configuration, arrangement, means, and/or components, whether described and/or illustrated herein, such as, but not limited to, electrical motors, hydraulic cylinders, springs, and/or servomechansims. Moreover, the pitch actuators may be driven by any suitable means, whether described and/or illustrated herein, such as, but not limited to, hydraulic fluid, electrical power, electro-chemical power, and/or mechanical power, such as, but not limited to, spring force. For example, in some embodiments, the pitch actuators include a pitch drive gear (not shown) that is coupled to a pitch ring gear (not shown). The pitch ring gear is coupled toblade24such that rotation of the pitch drive gear rotatesblade24about an axis of rotation (not shown) to thereby change the pitch ofblade24.In some embodiments, the pitch actuators may be driven by energy extracted from rotational inertia ofrotor18and/or a stored energy source (not shown) that supplies components ofwind turbine10, such as, but not limited to,control system40and/orpitch system62, energy during an anomaly inelectrical load39and/or power source coupled towind turbine10. For example, an anomaly in the electrical load and/or power source may include, but is not limited to, a power failure, an undervoltage condition, an overvoltage condition, and/or an out-of-frequency condition. As such, the stored energy source enables pitching ofblades24during the anomaly. Although other stored energy sources may be used, in some embodiments the stored energy source includes hydraulic accumulators, electrical generators, stored spring energy, capacitors, and/or batteries. The stored energy sources may be located anywhere within, on, adjacent to, and/or remote fromwind turbine10. In some embodiments, the stored energy source stores energy extracted from rotational inertia ofrotor18, energy stored within a frequency converter (not shown), and/or other auxiliary energy sources such as, but not limited to, an auxiliary wind turbine (not shown) coupled towind turbine10, solar panels, and/or hydro-power installations.Referring again toFIG. 3, in some embodiments,control system40includes abus63or other communications device to communicate information. At least oneprocessor64is coupled tobus63to process information, including information fromanemometry46,sensors48,50,52,54,56,58and/or60, and/or one or more other sensors.Control system40may also include at least one random access memory (RAM)66and/orother storage device68.RAM66andstorage device68are coupled tobus63to store and transfer information and instructions to be executed byprocessor64. RAM66(and/or alsostorage device68, if included) can also be used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions byprocessor64.Control system40may also include at least one read only memory (ROM)70and/or other static storage devices coupled tobus63to store and provide static (i.e., non-changing) information and instructions toprocessor64.Control system40further includes at least one input/output device72may include any device known in the art to provide input data to controlsystem40and/or to provide outputs, such as, but not limited to, yaw control and/or pitch control outputs. Instructions may be provided to memory from a storage device, such as, but not limited to, a magnetic disk, a read-only memory (ROM) integrated circuit, CD-ROM, and/or DVD, via a remote connection that is either wired or wireless providing access to one or more electronically-accessible media, etc. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry can be used in place of or in combination with software instructions. Thus, execution of sequences of instructions is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software instructions, whether described and/or illustrated herein.Control system40may also include at least onesensor interface74that allowscontrol system40to communicate withanemometry46,sensors48,50,52,54,56,58and/or60, and/or one or more other sensors.Sensor interface74can be or can include, for example, one or more analog-to-digital converters that convert analog signals into digital signals that can be used byprocessor64.FIG. 4is a flowchart illustrating anexemplary method100for controlling a wind turbine, such as, but not limited to, wind turbine10(shown inFIGS. 1,2and3).Method100includes measuring102an ambient air temperature, for example, usingsensor56. If the ambient air temperature is below a predetermined limit,method100includes decreasing104a power output ofwind turbine10, for example using control system40(shown inFIGS. 2 and 3) to facilitate reducing loads acting on components ofwind turbine10. For example, as ambient air temperature decreases, loads acting on components ofwind turbine10may increase. Moreover, and for example, a brittleness of components ofwind turbine10may also increase as ambient air temperature decreases, which may decrease a predetermined service life expectancy and/or accelerate fatigue of components ofwind turbine10. Therefore, decreasing104a power output ofwind turbine10may facilitate reducing loads acting on components ofwind turbine10due to the colder, denser ambient air by reducing a speed of the tips of rotor blades24(shown inFIGS. 1,2and3). As such, decreasing104a power output ofwind turbine10based on the ambient air temperature may facilitate maintaining loads acting on components ofwind turbine10within a predetermined design envelope ofwind turbine10.The predetermined ambient temperature limit may have any value that facilitates reducing loads acting on components ofwind turbine10due to the conditions of ambient air. For example, in some embodiments,wind turbine10is designed to operate within a predetermined ambient temperature up to a predetermined maximum wind speed, wherein the range extends between upper and lower temperature limits. In such embodiments, the predetermined ambient temperature limit may be the lower limit of such a predetermined temperature range. In some embodiments, and for example, the predetermined ambient temperature range is a normal international engineering code (IEC) design envelope. Examples of the predetermined ambient temperature limit include, but are not limited to, approximately +40 degrees Celsius (° C.) (about 100 degrees Fahrenheit (° F.)) to approximately −20° C. (about −30° F.).The power output ofwind turbine10may be decreased104using any suitable method, process, structure, and/or means. For example, in some embodiments,method100includes increasing a pitch angle of one ormore rotor blades24ofwind turbine10to thereby reduce a speed of the tips ofrotor blades24and decrease104the power output ofwind turbine10. The blade pitch angle may be increased by any value, such as but not limited to, between about 0.1° and about 90°. An example of a normal operation angle range ofwind turbine10is between about 0° and about 20°, while 90° is the feathered position in which no resulting torque acts on rotor18(shown inFIGS. 1,2and3). By adjusting the pitch angle, existing components of the wind energy turbine may still usable in cold weather conditions from a load envelope perspective. For example, the pitch angle of one ormore blades24is increased at rated wind speeds and at ambient air temperatures below the predetermined ambient temperature limit. This increase in pitch angle may help maintainwind turbine10within the design load envelope in cold weather conditions and at rated wind speeds. Specifically, such pitch control facilitates mitigating loads onblades24such that loads onblades24are maintained within operational parameters.Furthermore, in some embodiments,method100includes decreasing a torque ofgenerator rotor25. Decreasing such torque may be achieved by measuring gap flux or rotortorque using sensor58and usingcontrol system40to alter the flux withingap31as is known in the art. For example, the gap flux may be controlled usingcontrol system40and/or converter38(shown inFIG. 3). The flux ofgenerator26may be decreased to decrease a power output ofwind turbine10. For example, the flux ofgenerator26may be decreased to facilitate preventing rotor blade(s)26from stalling and/or to facilitate reducing an occurrence of rotor blade stall due to a predetermined ambient air temperature. Stalling of one ormore rotor blades24may decrease a power output ofwind turbine10as well as other effects as discussed below.According to some embodiments, output power ofwind turbine10is decreased if the ambient air temperature is below the predetermined ambient temperature limit, which for example can be the lower temperature limit of a predetermined ambient air temperature range for whichwind turbine10is designed. Decreasing the output power ofwind turbine10results in a reduction of the loads acting on components ofwind turbine10in that the speed of the tips ofrotor blades24are reduced so as to reduce the loads, for example causing the loads to stay within the existing calculated design envelope ofwind turbine10. Considering the ambient air temperature and decreasing the output ofwind turbine10if the ambient air temperature is below the predetermined ambient temperature limit, compensates for a potentially accelerated fatigue of the material of the individual components ofwind turbine10due to their brittleness in cold weather conditions. Also in that the output power ofwind turbine10is decreased, i.e. is iteratively reduced, the loads acting on components ofwind turbine10in cold weather conditions.As explained above, the normal IEC design envelope defines admissible loads acting onwind turbine10within a predetermined ambient air temperature range and up to a predetermined maximum wind speed. The loads may be defined inter alia by a calculated ambient air density. Accordingly, predetermined air densities are given in the normal IEC design envelope defining the loads onwind turbine10. Determining the air density in cold weather conditions by measuring the ambient air temperature and pressure is advantageous to reduce the loads acting onwind turbine10in accordance with the calculated air density so as to stay within the admissible loads for whichwind turbine10is configured. Thus, according to some embodiments, an air density determination can be used to effect the above-described load mitigations.Method100may be advantageous since no new components ofwind turbine10need be designed because, due to the reduction of the loads acting onwind turbine10in cold weather conditions, the existing design envelope ofwind turbine10will not be exceeded.If the ambient air temperature is above a predetermined limit,method100includes decreasing106a power output ofwind turbine10, for example using control system40(shown inFIGS. 1,2and3) to facilitate mitigating a potential for stalling ofwind turbine10. For example, as ambient air temperature increases, a potential for detachment of air flow aroundblades24may increase. Such detachment of air flow aroundblades24may induce instabilities within operation ofwind turbine10that include, but are not limited to, a reduction in electric power generation and/or a trip ofwind turbine10. Moreover, a sudden reattachment of wind flow aroundblades18may induce a sudden acceleration of the rotational speed ofblades18and a sudden increase in electric power output that may exceed control parameters associated withcontrol system40. Such acceleration and power surge may cause a trip ofwind turbine10. Such wind speed and power transients may decrease a predetermined service life expectancy and/or accelerate fatigue of components ofwind turbine10. Therefore, decreasing104a power output ofwind turbine10may facilitate reducing a potential for stall based on the ambient air temperature and may facilitate maintaining electric power generation and blade rotational speeds ofwind turbine10within a predetermined design envelope ofwind turbine10. Examples of the predetermined ambient temperature limit include, but are not limited to, approximately +40° C. (about 100° F.) to approximately −20° C. (about −30° F.). Methods of decreasing a power output ofwind turbine10include, but are not limited to, adjusting the associated blade pitch and adjusting generator torque, wherein both methods are described above.FIG. 5is a flowchart illustrating anotherexemplary method200for controlling wind turbine10(shown inFIG. 1). As compared tomethod100, in some embodiments, controlling a power output ofwind turbine10is based on at least one alternate ambient air condition in addition to or in lieu of ambient temperature limits. Such alternate conditions include, but are not limited to, ambient air pressure and humidity. As such, in some embodiments,method200includes determining202an ambient air temperature, determining204an ambient air pressure and/or determining206an ambient air humidity. The ambient air pressure, temperature and humidity may be determined by directly measuring the ambient air pressure, temperature and humidity, forexample using sensors54,56and60, respectively. Alternatively, additional measurements may include, but not be limited to rate of rain fall. Further, alternatively, some ambient air conditions including, but not being limited to, ambient air viscosity may be derived values based on measurements of other ambient air conditions known in the art.Method200further includes comparing208such measured ambient air conditions that include temperature, humidity and/or pressure to a plurality of predetermined temperature, humidity and/or pressure values. Such predetermined values may be derived based on, but not being limited to, an expected altitude ofwind turbine10. In one embodiment, such values may be derived via at least one algorithm and statically stored electronically within a table (not shown) that is maintained withincontrol system40. Alternatively, such predetermined values may be derived dynamically using at least one algorithm. Regardless,method step208is performed in a continuous and dynamic manner.Method200further includes determining210a current ambient air operating envelope for the existing ambient air conditions. In the exemplary embodiment,method step210is performed continuously and dynamically using at least one algorithm. Alternatively, each parameter measured and/or derived that is included within the envelope is calculated using at least one algorithm and stored statically within a table withincontrol system200. In the exemplary embodiment, such envelope includes a predetermined range of blade rotational speeds as well as a predetermined range of electric power generation outputs such that operation ofwind turbine10is facilitated as described herein. Alternatively, the envelope may include any operational parameter that facilitates operation ofwind turbine10as described herein. For example,control system40may calculate a blade tip speed ratio of one or more rotor blades24(shown inFIGS. 1,2and3) ofwind turbine10from instrument measurement signals that include, but are not limited to, a wind speed (for example measured using anemometry46), an ambient air temperature (for example measured usingsensor56, and/or a rotor speed (for example measured using sensor50). The tip speed ratio is typically referenced to a speed of a blade tip as compared to a free stream air flow wind velocity.Method200also includes determining212if the existing power output is within the range associated with the current ambient air operating envelope that is determined instep210. If the existing power output is within the envelope, typically no associated control action is transmitted fromcontrol system40. Alternately, if the existing power output is outside of the envelope, at least one operational parameter ofwind turbine10will be adjusted so as to adjust the power output. Such operational parameter may be associated with any component ofwind turbine10, such as, but not limited to, a pitch angle ofblades24and the magnitude and direction of the torque acting ongenerator rotor25.For example, in some embodiments,method200includes controlling214a pitch angle of one ormore rotor blades24based, at least in part, on the determined210ambient air operating envelope. For example, the pitch angle may be controlled using control system40(shown inFIGS. 2 and 3) and/or pitch system62(shown inFIG. 2). Controlling214a pitch angle may include increasing a pitch angle, decreasing a pitch angle, and/or maintaining a pitch angle for a predetermined period of time. The pitch angle of rotor blade(s)24may be controlled214to optimize a power output ofwind turbine10.

The flux ofgenerator26may be controlled216to increase a power output ofwind turbine10as well as decrease the power output. For example, the flux ofgenerator26may be controlled216to facilitate preventing rotor blade(s)26from stalling and/or to facilitate reducing an occurrence of rotor blade stall due to a predetermined combination of ambient air conditions. Stalling of one ormore rotor blades24may decrease a power output ofwind turbine10as well as other effects as discussed above.

       "  'description': 'RELATED APPLICATIONSThe present application is National Phase of International Application No. PCT/JP2008/064161 filed Aug. 6, 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to wind turbine blades and wind power generators that generate electricity using such wind turbine blades.BACKGROUND ARTOne problem with wind power generators is noise caused by blades. Recently, the size of wind power generators has been increased with the growing demand for high-power wind power generators. Accordingly, the rotor diameter, that is, the length of the wind turbine blades, has increased.The longer the blades are, the faster the blade tips move. Accordingly, a larger amount of noise occurs, and a further noise reduction has been demanded.The major sources of noise caused by blades are noise due to vortices at the tips of the blades and noise due to turbulence boundary layers occurring on the surfaces of the blades.In the related art, to reduce the noise level, it is thought to be effective to reduce the rotational speed of a rotor. That is, if the rotational speed of the rotor is reduced, the flow speed of air to the blades is decreased, so that aerodynamic sound can be reduced. However, if the rotational speed of the rotor is reduced, the power generation efficiency is decreased.To reduce noise without reducing the rotational speed of the rotor, for example, as disclosed in Patent Citation 1, a technique called serration has been proposed.This is intended to suppress Karman vortices from a trailing edge of a blade by forming a serrated portion at the trailing edge so as to cause longitudinal vortices. By suppressing Karman vortices, noise is reduced.Patent Citation 1:Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2003-336572DISCLOSURE OF INVENTIONThe blade disclosed in Patent Citation 1 has low flexibility in fabrication because serrations are molded integrally with the overall blade or are fixed to the blade with bolts.That is, the blade disclosed in Patent Citation 1 has serrations forming a portion of the blade, namely, an extended portion of the blade. In other words, the serrations are formed such that the trailing edge of the airfoil is cut in a serrated pattern.In general, a blade has an angle of attack with respect to the wind flow, and consequently a flow (cross flow) occurs at the trailing edge of the blade in a direction from the front side (lower surface) to the back side (upper surface) of the blade.Thus, serrations formed as an extended portion of a blade can themselves disturb the flow and therefore serve as a new source of noise.In addition, if a blade is attached with bolts, the bolted portions can serve as a new source of noise.In light of the above circumstances, the present invention provides a wind turbine blade having a serrated plate that can be formed irrespective of the overall structure of the blade and that can be attached in the optimum shape to effectively suppress noise occurring at the trailing edge thereof, and also provides a wind power generator using such a wind turbine blade.To solve the above problem, the present invention employs the following solutions.A first aspect of the present invention provides a wind turbine blade formed by bonding a back skin and a front skin and having a serrated plate attached to a trailing edge thereof, and the serrated plate has a serrated portion on a rear side thereof and is formed so as to be attached by bonding the back skin and the front skin.The wind turbine blade according to this aspect is formed by bonding the back skin and the front skin, whereas the serrated plate having the serrated portion on the rear side thereof is formed so as to be attached by bonding the back skin and the front skin; that is, the serrated plate is attached when the overall structure of the wind turbine blade, in other words, the joint structure of the back skin and the front skin, is formed.Accordingly, the serrated plate can be formed irrespective of the joint structure of the back skin and the front skin, so that it can be attached in the optimum shape to avoid noise, for example, a shape that can suppress formation of a cross flow, thus effectively suppressing noise occurring at the trailing edge.Large noise occurs at an end portion of the wind turbine blade, where the flow speed is high; therefore, in view of efficiently reducing noise, the serrated plate is preferably provided at the end portion. The end portion at which the serrated plate is provided is, for example, within 30%, more preferably within 20%, of the blade length from a blade tip toward a blade root.In the above aspect, the back skin and the front skin may be bonded with an adhesive, and the serrated plate may be inserted between the back skin and the front skin and be fixed with the adhesive.If the serrated plate is prepared independently of the back skin and the front skin and the back skin and the front skin are bonded with an adhesive, a portion of the serrated plate on the blade side is inserted between the back skin and the front skin and is inserted into an adhesive layer present therebetween. As the adhesive is dried, the back skin and the front skin are fixed, and accordingly the serrated plate is fixed.In this way, because the serrated plate is fixed by bonding the back skin and the front skin, no special attachment is required for attachment of the serrated plate, thus facilitating the attachment procedure.In addition, the serrated plate can be formed in the optimum shape to avoid noise, for example, a shape that can suppress formation of a cross flow, thus effectively suppressing noise occurring at the trailing edge.In the above configuration, an insertion portion of the serrated plate may have at least one protrusion protruding toward the back skin and/or the front skin.By doing so, a large resistance is caused by the protrusion, thus effectively preventing the serrated plate from coming off.In the above aspect, the serrated plate may be formed integrally with one of the back skin and the front skin, and an end of the other shell may be fitted to the shell.The serrated plate is formed integrally as a trailing-edge portion of the back skin or the front skin. Because the back skin and the front skin are separately formed, the serrated plate can be formed irrespective of the joint structure of the back skin and the front skin. Accordingly, the serrated plate can be formed in the optimum shape to avoid noise, for example, a shape that can suppress formation of a cross flow, thus effectively suppressing noise occurring at the trailing edge.In the above aspect, the serrated plate preferably has a shape extending along a streamline at the trailing edge.By doing so, a wind flow flows along the serrated plate, so that the formation of a flow from the front side (lower surface) to the back side (upper surface) of the blade, namely, a cross flow, is suppressed, thus inhibiting formation of a new source of noise.A second aspect of the present invention provides a wind power generator that generates electricity using a wind turbine blade that can effectively suppress noise occurring at a trailing edge thereof.By doing so, noise can be reduced during the operation of the wind power generator. This alleviates limitations due to noise, thus ensuring flexibility of installation sites; for example, it can be installed near a residential area.According to the present invention, because the wind turbine blade is formed by bonding the back skin and the front skin and, on the other hand, the serrated plate having the serrated portion on the rear side thereof is formed so as to be attached by bonding the back skin and the front skin, the serrated plate can be attached in the optimum shape to avoid noise, for example, a shape that can suppress formation of a cross flow, thus effectively suppressing noise occurring at the trailing edge.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGSFIG. 1is a side view schematically showing the overall structure of a wind power generator according to a first embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 2is a front view of a wind turbine blade according to the first embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 3is a sectional view along X-X inFIG. 2.FIG. 4is a partial enlarged view showing a trailing-edge portion of the wind turbine blade according to the first embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 5is a partial enlarged view showing another form of the trailing-edge portion of the wind turbine blade according to the first embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 6is a partial perspective view showing the attachment structure of a serrated plate according to the first embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 7is a partial perspective view showing the attachment structure of another form of the serrated plate according to the first embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 8is a partial perspective view showing the attachment structure of a serrated plate according to a second embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 9is a partial perspective view showing the joint structure of a back skin and a front skin according to the second embodiment of the present invention.EXPLANATION OF REFERENCE1: wind power generator9: wind turbine blade19: back skin21: front skin29: flow33: trailing edge35: serrated plate37: serrated portion39: adhesive layer41: insertion portion43: protrusionBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONFirst EmbodimentA wind power generator1according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below on the basis of the drawings.FIG. 1is a side view schematically showing the overall structure of the wind power generator1.As shown inFIG. 1, the wind power generator1includes a tower3provided in an upright position on afoundation11, anacelle5installed on the top end of the tower3so as to be rotatable substantially horizontally, with the tower3serving as a pivot, arotor head7provided on thenacelle5so as to be rotatable about a substantially horizontal axis, and a plurality ofwind turbine blades9attached to therotor head7so as to extend radially around the rotation axis thereof and to be rotatable about the blade length direction.The force of wind striking thewind turbine blades9in the rotation axis direction of therotor head7is converted into power rotating therotor head7about the rotation axis direction thereof.Ananemometer13for measuring ambient wind speed value, ananemoscope15for measuring wind direction, and an arrester (not shown) are provided at appropriate positions (for example, the top) on the peripheral surface of thenacelle5.A generator (not shown) coupled to therotor head7via a gearbox (not shown) coaxial therewith is installed in thenacelle5. That is, the generator is driven while accelerating the rotation of therotor head7using the gearbox to attain generator output.FIG. 2is a front view of awind turbine blade9.FIG. 3is a sectional view along X-X inFIG. 2.Thewind turbine blade9is a hollow member having an airfoil shape in cross section. The airfoil shape of thewind turbine blade9is defined by askin17formed of, for example, a fiberglass reinforced plastic. Theskin17is composed of two half segments bonded to each other, namely, aback skin19and afront skin21, and is reinforced inside by, for example, a main girder (not shown).In use, thewind turbine blade9is arranged such that ablade chord25has a certain angle with respect to awind direction27. This angle is referred to as the angle of elevation attack a.As shown inFIG. 3, a wind flow (streamline)29around thewind turbine blade9is introduced along awind direction27toward a leadingedge31, flows along theback skin19and thefront skin21, and flows in a direction along thewind direction27at a trailingedge33. Theflow29at the trailingedge33is typically a flow from thefront skin21to theback skin19.Aserrated plate35is provided at a portion of ablade tip23side (end portion) at the trailingedge33of thewind turbine blade9. The length of theserrated plate35in the blade length direction is, for example, substantially 20% of the blade length from theblade tip23toward ablade root24.This is intended to efficiently reduce noise by providing theserrated plate35at a portion where the flow speed is high, that is, where large noise occurs; from this viewpoint, depending on the length of thewind turbine blade9, the length of theserrated plate35in the blade length direction is within 30%, more preferably within 20%, of the blade length from theblade tip23toward theblade root24.If a further noise reduction is desired without much consideration of the efficiency of noise reduction, for example, theserrated plate35may be provided over the entire blade length.Theserrated plate35is plate-shaped, is flat along theflow29, as shown inFIGS. 3 and 4, and has aserrated portion37on the rear side thereof, as shown inFIG. 2.As shown inFIG. 5, theserrated plate35may be curved along theflow29. By doing so, theflow29can be allowed to flow more smoothly along theserrated plate35.FIG. 6shows the attachment structure of theserrated plate35.Theserrated plate35is held between theback skin19and thefront skin21at the trailingedge33, with the front thereof extending into a space surrounded by theback skin19and thefront skin21. That is, abent insertion portion41inserted into an adhesive layer (adhesive)39bonding theback skin19and thefront skin21at the trailingedge33is provided in the front of theserrated plate35.In other words, theinsertion portion41of theserrated plate35is held and retained between theback skin19and thefront skin21at the trailingedge33and is fixed and retained by theadhesive layer39.Thewind turbine blade9is produced as follows.First, theback skin19, thefront skin21, the reinforcement such as the main girder, and theserrated plate35are molded in predetermined shapes.For example, thefront skin21is placed with the inner side thereof facing upward. An end of the reinforcement, such as the main girder, is bonded to thefront skin21. An adhesive is then applied to the other end of the reinforcement, such as the main girder, and theadhesive layer39is put on the peripheral portion, including the leadingedge31and the trailingedge33.After an adhesive is similarly applied to theback skin19, theback skin19is placed on thefront skin21while being positioned. At the same time, theinsertion portion41of theserrated plate35is inserted into theadhesive layer39and is held and retained between theback skin19and thefront skin21.In this state, as theadhesive layer39etc. are dried, theback skin19and thefront skin21are fixed, and accordingly theserrated plate35is fixed.In this way, because theserrated plate35is fixed by bonding theback skin19and thefront skin21, no special attachment is required for attachment of theserrated plate35, thus facilitating the attachment procedure.In this embodiment, theinsertion portion41is plate-shaped; as shown inFIG. 7, it may haveprotrusions43protruding toward theback skin19and thefront skin21and extending in the blade length direction.By doing so, a large resistance is caused by theprotrusions43against the direction in which theinsertion portion41comes off, thus effectively preventing theserrated plate35from coming off.Next, the operation of the thus-configured wind power generator1will be described.In operation, the wind power generator1measures wind direction using theanemoscope15. Thenacelle5is rotated on the basis of the measurement results so that the wind blows in the rotation axis direction of therotor head7. That is, the wind blows thewind turbine blade9in a predetermined direction.As the wind strikes thewind turbine blade9, a lift occurs in a direction crossing the blade surface. The lift moves thewind turbine blade9, thus rotating therotor head7about the rotation axis thereof.The generator is driven while accelerating the rotation of therotor head7using the gearbox to generate electricity.The pitch angle of thewind turbine blade9is adjusted by rotating it about the blade length direction depending on the wind speed measured by theanemometer13. If the wind speed is low, the pitch angle is increased to increase the wind-receiving area. If the wind speed exceeds the rotational speed at which the rated output is reached, that is, the rated rotational speed, the pitch angle is decreased to decrease the wind-receiving area.At this time, because theserrated plate35is provided at the trailingedge33along the blade length direction, theserrated portion37suppresses formation of a Karman vortex street behind the trailing edge of thewind turbine blade9. Thus, noise due to a Karman vortex street can be reliably suppressed.In this embodiment, additionally, because the portion of theserrated plate35protruding from the trailingedge33has a shape extending along theflow29at the trailingedge33, theflow29flows along theserrated plate35. This suppresses formation of the flow from thefront skin21to theback skin19at the trailing edge of theserrated portion37of theserrated plate35, namely, a cross flow, thus inhibiting formation of a new source of noise.This effectively suppresses noise occurring at the trailingedge33.In this embodiment, additionally, because thewind turbine blade9has theserrated plate35at the end portion thereof, where large noise occurs because of the high movement speed, noise can be efficiently reduced.This eliminates the need for reducing the rotational speed for noise reduction, thus inhibiting a decrease in performance, such as power generation efficiency, in the wind power generator1.Second EmbodimentNext, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described usingFIGS. 8 and 9.In this embodiment, the basic structure is similar to that of the first embodiment, but it differs in the structure of the trailingedge33of thewind turbine blade9. In this embodiment, therefore, this difference will be described, and a redundant description of the other portions will be omitted.The same elements as those of the first embodiment are denoted by the same references, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted.FIG. 8is a partial perspective view showing the attachment structure of theserrated plate35.FIG. 9is a partial perspective view showing the joint structure of theback skin19and thefront skin21.Theserrated plate35is formed integrally with theback skin19as a trailing-edge extended portion of theback skin19.Theserrated plate35is angled with respect to theback skin19so as to extend along theflow29during the assembly of thewind turbine blade9.Afitting groove45extending in the blade length direction is formed on the inner side of the boundary between theback skin19and theserrated plate35, that is, on thefront skin21side.On the other hand, afitting portion47that fits into thefitting groove45is formed at the end of thefront skin21at the trailingedge33.For thiswind turbine blade9, theback skin19integrated with theserrated plate35, thefront skin21, and the reinforcement such as the main girder are molded in predetermined shapes.Thus, because theback skin19and thefront skin21are separately formed, theserrated plate35can be formed irrespective of the joint structure of theback skin19and the front skin21(wind turbine blade9). Accordingly, theserrated plate35can be formed in the optimum shape to avoid noise, that is, a shape extending along theflow29.Next, for example, theback skin19is placed with the inner side thereof facing upward. An end of the reinforcement, such as the main girder, is bonded on top of theback skin19. An adhesive is then applied to the other end of the reinforcement, such as the main girder, and an adhesive is applied to the peripheral portion, including the leadingedge31and the trailingedge33.After an adhesive is similarly applied to thefront skin21, thefront skin21is placed on theback skin19while being positioned. At this time, at the trailingedge33, the position of thefitting portion47of thefront skin21is adjusted so as to fit into thefitting groove45of theback skin19, thus bonding theback skin19and thefront skin21.In this way, because theserrated plate35is fixed by bonding theback skin19and thefront skin21, no special attachment is required for attachment of theserrated plate35, thus facilitating the attachment procedure.In addition, theback skin19and thefront skin21can be reliably and accurately fixed together by fitting thefitting portion47into thefitting groove45. This also allows theserrated plate35to be reliably positioned.Thefitting groove45may be a hole having any shape, and thefitting portion47may be a protrusion that fits into that hole.In addition, theserrated plate35may be attached integrally to thefront skin21side, rather than to theback skin19side.The operation of the thus-configured wind power generator1is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment, and a redundant description thereof will be omitted here.The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above; it may be changed without departing from the spirit thereof.',\n",

The above disclosure sets forth a number of embodiments of the present invention. Other arrangements or embodiments, not precisely set forth, could be practiced under the teaching of the present invention and as set forth in the following claims.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNatural energy is available throughout the world in various forms such as wind, solar, tidal and wave energy. Wind turbines have been used for production of electricity although such use has typically been limited to the production of small amounts of direct current (DC) electricity.Conventional sources of energy for the production of electricity are in an ever-dwindling supply, which necessitates that natural forms of energy be utilized to a greater extent. The natural forms of energy are effectively inexhaustible and are typically available in different forms throughout the world.The first machine to generate electricity from wind was designed and built in Denmark in 1890. Subsequently, several hundred machines were built in that country.In the United States, wind machines were widely used to generate electricity in rural areas until the 1930's, providing farmers with electricity, when the US Congress enacted the Rural Electrification Act, which effectively electrified the country.In 1931, in the (then) Soviet Union, the first relatively large wind turbine of 100-kilowatt capacity was built.In 1941, in the United States, a 1,250-kilowatt wind machine was designed and built. Shortly after beginning the operation, a main bearing and a blade failed. Because of World War II, the machine was never repaired and it was subsequently dismantled.Today wind turbines for producing electricity are widely used in some countries. In 2007 Germany was a leading power in wind energy production followed by USA:1. Germany—22.248 MW, 2. USA—16.818 MW, 3. Spain—15.145 MW, 4. India—8.000 MW, 5. China—6.050 MW.In 2008 the leading German firm Enercon began installation of the world's largest wind turbine Enercon E-126 with a power of 6-megawatt (MW) which is enough to supply electricity to 4,500.—homes. The diameter of the rotor of E-126 is 126 meters. The weight of the nacelle (gondola) is 75 tons. The tower is almost 200 meters tall. For comparison, the Eiffel tower is 300 meters tall.Today most of the contemporary machines in the world are of the horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) type; only less than 10% are of the vertical-axis (VAWT) type.Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical power through the use of a rotor that spins a shaft. The shaft is connected to a generator that converts the mechanical power into electricity.The horizontal-axis type machines, in addition to the tower and the foundation include:Blades which consist of aluminum reinforced with fiberglass. They have a heavy composite cross section which now reaches 8 cm for 2 to 3 MW production machines.A hub which connects the blades to the low-speed shaft. The hub transmits the torque developed by the rotor blades to the shaft.A pitch-control assembly for tilting the blades in the hub in order to properly adjust them to the so-called “angle of attack” of the wind. This means that the total surface area of the blade's assembly facing the wind changes. When the wind is weak, the surface gets bigger. When the wind is strong, each blade turns on its base and the total surface area gets smaller to reduce the wind pressure in order for the blade assembly to rotate with a constant speed.A brake designed to stop the spinning main shaft in case of high winds. Usually a disc brake, similar to the one in automobiles.A gearbox that converts the shaft's high-torque low-speed motion into low-torque high-speed motion that fits the electric generator's requirement. The shaft rotates on average at about 12 to 22 rpm while the generator requires approximately 1,800 rpm.A generator, whose function is to convert the shaft torque into electricity.A nacelle consisting of a cabin that houses all of the above mentioned elements. In modern turbines the nacelle is often of the size of a school bus or bigger. The nacelle sits atop a tower, such as a tubular steel or concrete tower or a lattice tower. Presently there is a trend is to use taller towers because the wind energy typically exponentially increases with the height.A yaw assembly whose function is to support the entire machine assembly inside the nacelle on top of the tower and to permit its rotation for alignment with the wind.This clearly illustrates that converting wind energy directly into electricity utilizing wind turbines involves elaborate equipment and requires high initial costs.Prior Technology:As the need for storing energy increased, in 1979 Hanley patented an invention in which wind energy is used to produce electricity that is used to lift water from downstream to upstream of a dam with a hydropower plant. The lifted water is stored as potential energy. Upon demand, the water is used to generate electricity.His invention addresses the problem of storing wind energy as water potential energy. However, it has the disadvantage of converting wind energy to hydraulic power. Therefore, Hanley's invention, assuming its technical feasibility, involves elaborate equipment and requires high initial costs.In an effort to make offshore wind power facilities even more reliable, Siemens Energy is now testing a new type of wind turbine that works without a gearbox. The main benefit of the new unit lies in its more simplified design, which requires fewer machine components, and will therefore result in lower maintenance costs and a higher level of reliability. This is especially important for offshore facilities, where turbine breakdowns are always very expensive.The first of the wind turbines without gearboxes has been erected in 2008 in western Denmark. This turbine has an output of 3.6 megawatts (MW). With a rotor diameter of 107 meters.The project is in a research phase for two years and will enable Siemens Energy to determine whether or not the units without gearboxes will be able to compete with conventional models and, if so, in which performance classes. Wind turbines without gearboxes are generally heavier than conventional units and also more expensive to produce.The units without gearboxes are instead equipped with synchronous generators that are stimulated by so-called permanent magnets. They directly convert the rotor's movements into electrical energy. The two generators in Denmark boost a torque of roughly 2,500 kilonewton-meters each. By comparison, a powerful electric drive system for a car has torque of significantly less than one kilonewton-meter.Deficiency of Prior Technology:The advantages of wind energy are that it is renewable, nonpolluting, and free.The disadvantages of wind energy are that it is diluted, unpredictable, and requires high initial costs. When wind is not blowing, the wind producing equipment sits idly by and there is no electricity. Wind energy is only available when the wind is blowing within a particular range of wind speeds, i.e., the turbine cannot operate at wind speeds (also called velocities) below the minimum speed and cannot safely operate above the maximum speed. Typically, the minimum speed is 7-8 km/h and the maximum speed is 60 km/h. Hence, the wind energy is only available intermittently. Further, wind power is dependent on the location because it is only seasonal in many areas of the world.The major disadvantages of the currently used wind turbines are:Each has its own electric generating equipment, a gearbox linked to an AC generator atop a tower. Electric equipment is very heavy and expensive and therefore initial cost is very high. Gearboxes for contemporary wind turbines are very big, heavy and expensive machineries. There are two more problems with them. Presently the market demand for them is too high and their availability is insufficient. The manufacturing capacity lags behind the demand about 2 years. And because said gearboxes and generators are big and heavy, it is difficult to lift them to the top of today's tall wind turbine towers. Also, because of their weight and size, the construction of the towers must be very robust. Another object of this invention is to eliminate them altogether in some specific embodiments.Each has its own pitch-control assembly. Some smaller turbines are without said assembly. They have a so-called fixed pitch wind turbine rotor. A fixed pitch wind turbine rotor is a simplification at a lower cost over that of a controllable blade pitch wind turbine rotor. However, a fixed pitch rotor is harder to start because the blade pitch for efficient operation is different from that for good starting. A proposed solution to bring the wind turbine rotor up to operating speed is to use its own generator as a motor during startup. A fixed pitch turbine rotor is designed to stall in high winds in order to limit rotor torque and not to damage the generator. This invention eliminates the pitch-control assembly.The machines are too big, tall and bulky. For example, on a large 5 MW turbine the blades alone could be over 18 tons even with the use of carbon fiber reinforcement. The blades diameter now reaches over 120 meters. The generator alone could be over 55 tons.The tall towers and blades up to 65 meters long are difficult to transport. Transportation can now cost 20% of equipment costs.In horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT), the electric generating equipment is installed atop the tower. The present day towers are very tall which makes installation difficult and sometime impossible in remote and high elevation locations because there are not adequate roads for big cranes to get there to deliver and install the heavy equipment. However, high elevations are the best for harvesting wind energy because of continuous high winds there. Besides the problems with installation, the operation and maintenance on the top of large towers is difficult. The blades are also subject to high vibrations during wind gusts and often bend or break apart. All of this shortens the equipment's life span.The majority of HAWTs use an upwind design, with the rotor facing the wind in front of the tower. Downwind variants suffer from fatigue and structural failure caused by turbulence when a blade passes through the tower's wind shadow.The electricity produced by the windmills must be consumed immediately. Usually wind blows harder at night. The demand for electricity at night is lowest. This creates an operational problem for the utility to whose grid the windmills are connected.When wind is not blowing, the entire system is not working and no electricity is produced.SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONIn the present invention the major difference from the prior art is the use of water tank reservoirs as pressure vessels for storing energy. This results in several advantages of cost and energy savings when compared to the use of standard wind turbines. At the same time water in these reservoirs could be used in times of dry periods for watering and other needs.It is an object of the present invention to reduce the cost of converting wind energy into electricity by directly coupling wind turbines with water pumps that will lift the water from lower elevation to higher elevation where it is stored as potential energy.Another object of the present invention is to utilize all wind potential, weak and strong and more remote and high location areas.Another object of the present invention is to utilize any type of windmill, vertical-axis or horizontal-axis.Another object of the present invention is to harness the wind energy in an economical way and to improve productivity and cost effectiveness of the wind turbines.Another object of the present invention is to utilize the advantages of less expensive water pumps to generate electricity compared to the standard current wind electric generators.Another object of the present invention is to have a hybrid wind turbine electricity generating system that converts the wind energy into kinetic water energy to directly drive a generator by means of a turbine thus avoiding the need for a gearbox.Another object of the present invention is to eliminate the use of a nacelle in certain embodiments of the present invention as an unnecessary addition to the tower because of the reduced number and size of the components and therefore the reduced need for protection and maintenance of these components.Another object of the present invention is to enable an easy and fast installation of the system, especially in remote locations, because of the smaller and fewer components.Another object of the present invention is to provide a system that has the capability of storing water as potential energy in a way that said water can be circulated and returned back into the system to produce electricity for the grid again.Another object of the present invention is to provide a system that will direct the internally, primary produced wind electricity to operate a water pump lifting low elevation water into high elevation water thus converting it into potential energy for producing secondary electricity ready for the grid or for private use.Another object of the present invention is to provide an option for a HAWT with a downwind orientation of the blade's assembly to engage reinforcements for protecting these blades from bending and braking.Another object of the invention is to build wind turbines with fewer and smaller components, which could be easily installed on remote locations without a need for big cranes.Yet another object of the invention, in general, is to manage the wind energy to suit the needs for electricity consumption.Further objects of the invention will appear as the description proceeds.To the accomplishment of the above and related objects, this invention may be embodied in the form illustrated in the accompanying drawings, attention being called to the fact, that the drawings are schematic only and that changes may be made in the specific construction illustrated and described within the scope of the appended claims.Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following descriptions, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of illustration and example, an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1Aschematically shows a hybrid electric generating system of the present invention utilizing a horizontal-axis wind turbine.FIG. 1Bis identical toFIG. 1Aexcept that thegearbox7is missing.FIGS. 1C & 1Dare examples of some embodiments of the hybrid electric generating system of the present invention without the nacelle.FIG. 1Eschematically illustrates the hybrid electric generating system of the present invention wherein the large lower water reservoir is positioned underground, under or near the main tower.FIG. 2Aschematically shows a hybrid electric generating system of the present invention utilizing a vertical-axis wind turbine.FIG. 2Bis identical toFIG. 2Aexcept that thegearbox7is missing.FIG. 3Aschematically shows a hybrid electric generating system of the present invention utilizing a horizontal-axis wind turbine with a direct rotor to pump mechanical connection for motion transfer utilizing a differential type gearbox wherein the two shafts of said gearbox form a 90 degree angle.FIG. 3Bschematically shows a hybrid electric generating system of the present invention utilizing a vertical-axis wind turbine with a direct rotor to pump mechanical connection and not utilizing any gearbox.

It is to be understood, however, that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner.The present invention is directed to wind turbine towers or tower systems configured for storing water in water containers within the tower structure itself and/or next to it and for generating electricity using the potential energy of the stored water. Briefly, the towers of modern, utility-scale wind turbine tower systems are typically metal or cement structures with a circular cross section that in addition to supporting a nacelle are adapted, according to the present invention, to store water. To achieve this functionality, the tower is modified by providing two or more water containers within the tower or near it and when necessary, reinforcing the tower structure with additional materials. Additionally, the invention builds on the proximity of water and electrical support equipment to the wind turbine to improve efficiencies by connecting this equipment to the wind turbine power converter. This arrangement avoids the losses and inefficiencies associated with many prior electricity generating designs that include multiple power conversions.One advantage of the present system is that the need for a pitch-control assembly might be eliminated. The pitch-control assembly is again an expensive and a heavy addition to the wind turbine rotor. The present invention preferably uses a fixed pitch wind turbine rotor. A fixed pitch wind turbine rotor offers a simplification at lower cost over that of a controllable blade pitch wind turbine rotor. A fixed pitch turbine rotor is designed to stall in high winds, to limit rotor's torque. Therefore, the generator must be capable of absorbing the maximum power output the rotor can generate. The rotor in turn must have the capability to not critically overspeed in the event the load is removed from it. The present invention does that by continuously circulating water. Thus, in a sense, the load could never be removed from it.An even more important advantage of the present invention is that it produces more power because any wind, weak or strong, may be harnessed. Wind blows at variable speed, sometimes gusting, while the electric generators powered by the wind turbine must rotate at a constant speed because the AC current generated must have a constant frequency. This requires that the blades of the wind turbine be automatically adjusted in order to rotate at a constant speed. This is done by the pitch-control assembly. But the pitch-control doesn't do all the job expected from it. With a conventional wind turbine, when the wind is weak, the turbine doesn't work because there is a minimum starting wind velocity needed. When the wind is too strong, at the maximum wind velocity, the turbine has to be stopped because it will bend or break the blades or it will turn the generator at higher rotations, which will disable it from delivering the required 50 to 60 Hz of AC power for the grid utility system.The preference for using a fixed pitch wind turbine rotor in the present invention is not only because it is cheaper but mainly because it can harness more wind energy. This type of rotor is turning faster during high winds as opposed to a rotor with pitch-controlled blades, which keeps on turning with the same speed in all conditions. This means that the pitch-controlled blades are missing much of the energy that could be harnessed during high winds. The energy of the wind doubles when the speed doubles. The fixed pitch rotor captures that energy which can double many times between low and high speeds. The present system then conserves that energy for later use.The pitch-control rotor misses on all of that action. It may keep on turning during high wind and it creates an illusion that it is working hard but it is actually capturing the same amount of energy because it is rotating with the same speed as if the wind speed was low. Most of the wing energy, which we don't see just by looking at it, is lost between the blades.The use of water containers as pressure vessels for storing energy results in a cost and energy savings when compared to the use of standard wind turbines. The incremental cost of modifying the tower to store water is significantly less than providing separate water pressure equipment (such as water dams). Energy is saved because the volume provided by a typical tower is so large that a large quantity of mass of water can be temporarily stored at lower expense for later use and could be continuously circulated.The following description begins with a discussion of a system for storing water within a wind turbine tower with reference toFIGS. 1A & 1B. The system also includes features for generating electricity using the stored water, and for distributing the produced electricity. The description then continues with reference to the rest of the FIGURES with more particular discussions of wind turbine tower systems configured according to the invention, showing various techniques for modifying towers for storage and for making use of the stored water. Finally, with reference toFIGS. 4A,7A & B and8A & B a method of designing, fabricating, and operating a wind turbine tower system with in-tower and in-building water storages and additional tower(s) with water storage reservoirs connected to the primary wind turbine is described in detail. At the end, in series ofFIG. 9, needed reinforcements of a fixed blade assembly are shown.With reference toFIG. 1Athe essential concept of the present invention and the means by which it is intended to operate may be appreciated.FIG. 1Ashows a wind turbine assembly comprising a vertically alignedtower1firmly attached to thebase2. On the top of thetower1there is the blades section, which comprises plurality ofturbine blades3, attached to ahub4. This assembly, the blades with the hub together, is called rotor. Said rotor, for the present invention, is preferably a fixed pitch rotor. There is thenacelle5housing thefirst shaft6, which transmits the low-speed, high-torque power from the blade'srotor hub4to thegearbox7. Thegearbox7is basically a transmission which converts the power from saidfirst shaft6to thesecond shaft8, and transfers the now high-speed, low-torque rotation ofshaft8to theprimary power generator9. The average speed of the lowspeed input shaft6may vary from 12 to 60 rpm but the required speed for an AC generator to produce electricity is between 1,200 to 3,600 rpm. Therefore the high-speed output shaft8turns with about this many rotations depending upon the wind conditions and the generator requirements.If thegenerator9is a DC generator then the above ratio could be different. A DC generator can produce electricity at any speed. For our purposes the DC generator is preferable but because there are already so many wind turbine systems on the market with an AC generator incorporated in them and ready for use, an AC generator is acceptable and could be adapted into the system of the present invention.If the whole system is built from scratch, then for economic purposes thegenerator9should be a DC generator. The reason is that a DC generator may produce electricity on both low and high-speed shaft rotation thus it can work with low and high winds. For the same reason it doesn't need a pitch-control and it can work with fixed pitch blades. This allows reducing the size of thegearbox7or even eliminating it entirely as shown inFIG. 1B.At10a yaw assembly is permitting a horizontal rotation of the nacelle for alignment with the wind. The yaw assembly is controlled by an electronic control box (not shown) which tells it which way and how much to turn. The control box gets its data from an anemometer and a wind vane (not shown). The anemometer measures the wind speed and the wind vane measures the wind direction.At11a lower water tank reservoir is shown. This reservoir may be inside the tower, next to the tower, around the tower or underground. At12an upper water tank reservoir is shown (because it is smaller we will call it a container). This container stores water as a potential energy. When wind is blowing the primaryelectric power generator9produces electricity which turns, via electric wires (not shown),electric motor13.Electric motor13is coaxially linked to pump14, which draws water fromreservoir11and throughconduit15delivers it to theupper water tank12. Said water then under pressure passes through the propeller ofwater turbine17via theconduit16with a nozzle at the lower end (not shown). The falling water then releases its potential energy into kinetic energy of the spinning turbine shaft. Theturbine17turns the auxiliary, coaxially connected to it, shaft of anAC generator18which then produces electricity for the grid or for private use. After utilizing its kinetic energy the water continues on moving and it is collected back into thelower reservoir11ready to be reused.In the present invention, because the blades might be fixedly attached to the hub, they could be set to start turning the turbine at a lower wind speed and then keep on turning it at high speeds without having to stop it. A very high wind speed will turn the rotor faster and in turn it will deliver more primary electricity for the internal use of the system, which will then turn faster thepump14and overflow theupper water container12. However, the overflow water will be returned unused and collected back into thelower reservoir11. At the same time pressure on theturbine17and the adjacentsecond generator18will remain constant, thus the same frequency of electricity will be produced at any time, regardless of the wind speed. The rotor doesn't have to stop rotating.Therefore, by utilizing the present invention, longer working hours will be achieved, compared to the conventional wind turbines. Also more remote or high locations for installation of such turbines could be reached because of the extended working land area of the present system. For example, some places are not windy enough for the contemporary wind turbines in use and others are too windy. Other places are located on a high altitude.With reference toFIGS. 1C & 1Din the drawings a vertical-axis wind turbine is shown, according to the present invention, the nacelle on top of the main tower is removed because of the smaller number and size of the components compared to a standard wind turbine. This may be applied to all embodiments of the invention.With reference toFIG. 1Ein the drawings a vertical-axis wind turbine is shown according to the present invention wherein themain reservoir11is positioned underground, under or nearby the wind tower. This may be applied to all of the embodiments of the invention.With reference toFIGS. 2A & 2Bin the drawings a vertical-axis wind turbine is shown, according to the present invention. Except for the blades and the vertical shaft, everything else in this embodiment is the same as inFIGS. 1A & 1B. The shaft of the rotor assembly in this embodiment is vertical and it is connected toshaft6of thegearbox7, (FIG. 2A) or directly connected toshaft8of the generator9(FIG. 2B). In this embodiment thegearbox7, (FIG. 2A) and thegenerator9are also positioned vertically inside the tower's body. In the embodiment ofFIG. 2Bthegearbox7and is eliminated and there is no need for a yaw assembly.With reference toFIG. 3Ain the drawings a horizontal-axis wind turbine according to the present invention is shown. In this embodiment everything is the same as inFIG. 1Aexcept that thegearbox7and thegenerator9on the top of thetower assembly1are missing andmotor13andwater pump14connected to thelower reservoir11are missing. Instead,shaft6from the blade assembly transfers its horizontal rotation into vertical rotation ofshaft20via adifferential type gearbox21. In this type of gearbox the twoshafts6and20form a 90 degree angle.Shaft20passes through the middle of theyaw assembly10. Saidshaft20then transmits its rotation directly to thewater pump22. Thewater pump22is connected via theconduit15such as a pipe or a hose to thelower reservoir11. When the wind is blowing the rotation of the blade assembly is directly, mechanically transmitted to thepump22which then pumps water from thelower reservoir11via saidconduit15and delivers it into theupper container12. All other operations of this embodiment are the same as described for the embodiment ofFIG. 1A.InFIG. 3Ban embodiment of a vertical-axis wind turbine is shown, according to the invention. In this embodiment everything is the same as inFIG. 3Aexcept that the blades are vertical and the rotor is vertical. Thedifferential type gearbox21and theyaw assembly10have been eliminated because there is no need for them. The turbine has avertical axis6, which is linked toshaft20. Saidshaft20directly turns thewater pump22. The rest of the operation of this embodiment is the same as for theFIG. 3A.With reference toFIG. 4in the drawings a different concept of a wind turbine is presented. Herein, next to the basic concept of previous FIG., there is awater storage tower23with an elevatedlarge water reservoir24and afoundation25. The volume ofreservoir24is many times the volume ofcontainer12but smaller thenreservoir11.Reservoir24stores water as potential energy for times when there is low wind or no wind.The embodiment inFIG. 4works as follows: When the wind is blowing and the turbine's rotor is turning an electrical transmission line delivers electricity from thegenerator9tomotor13. Said motor turns thewater pump14, which pumps water from thelower reservoir11and viaconduit15and15adeposits it into thecontainer12. When water reaches its maximum predetermined level incontainer12it lifts the floatingball28a, or similar means, and closes theend valve28ofconduit15a. Water then continues viaconduit15bup intoreservoir24. Thevalve28constantly opens and closes because the water level in saidcontainer12constantly rises and drops since said water is used to run the hydro-turbine17after which it is discharged back intoreservoir11for reuse. When the water level drops, thevalve28opens and more water enters inside thecontainer12, which again rises the water level and closes the valve.When the wind isstrong pump14gets sufficient power to pump water fromcontainer11which is enough to fill thecontainer12up to the level which closesvalve28. This means that no more water enterscontainer12and water continues upconduit15bto reach thereservoir24for storage and for later use.When the water level incontainer12is low again, water fromreservoir24leaves said reservoir and viaconduit26is delivered back intocontainer12. The level of the opening26aon the bottom ofreservoir24, where water entersconduit26, is always higher then the permitted predetermined maximum water level incontainer12. There is a funnel-shapedvalve attachment27at the other end whereconduit26enterscontainer12. There is a floatingball27a(FIGS. 5A & 5B) or a flowing funnel-shaped device27b(FIGS. 6A & 6B) inside saidvalve attachment27for closing said valve in order to prevent water fromconduit26to flow into said container when necessary.When water is drained fromreservoir24intocontainer12and water level in said container rises, the water lifts the floatingball27a, or the funnel-shaped device27b, which then closes thevalve27and no more water can enter into saidcontainer12. This keeps automatically the amount of water inside said container at the same level, which means that the pressure on the hydro-turbine17is always the same. Saidvalve27constantly opens and closes in order to keep the water level quite even. Thus said hydro-turbine17revolves with the same speed and always delivers an even AC current through theelectric generator18for the grid network no mater what the water pressure inreservoir24is.At a time when there is no wind and the rotor assembly of the wind turbine rotor is not turning, theAC generator18will still delivers electric power for the utility grid untilreservoir24is empty.On the other hand, when at night the demand for electric power is low but there is wind, the connection to the utility power grid could be shut down. This means that hydro-turbine17will stop revolving, no water will be passing downconduit16andcontainer12will quickly fill up. This will first closevalve27and thenvalve28, which is positioned higher thenvalve27. Closing thevalve28will prevent water from draining fromreservoir24intocontainer12. Because of the available wind, the blade assembly of therotor4will keep on turning. Thepump14then will keep on pumping water fromreservoir11viaconduits15, which is split into15aand15b. Butvalve27already closed15atherefore water will continue via15bonly up towards thelarge water reservoir24for storage. Thus the system will be accumulating water as potential energy for later use.If the wind is too strong, the water may overflow thelarge reservoir24. In that case the excess water will be returned unused via theoverflow conduit29back to theprimary reservoir11.InFIGS. 5A&Band6A&B the funnel-shaped valve27(28is the same) and the floatingball27aor the floating funnel-shaped device27binside are shown up and down. When the water level is high it lifts them up and they close the valves. When the water level is low, they drop down and open the valves. They are prevented from escaping from the valves by the grid attachment27cat the bottom of the valves. Said grid attachment27chowever allows the water to freely enter and leave said valves.InFIG. 7Athe wind turbine is the same as inFIG. 3A. The only difference is thatwater pump22is now positioned low, inside or nearreservoir11andshaft20is extended downwards to directly connect with said pump. The advantage of this arrangement is that when saidpump22is down, it does not transfer its vibrations directly to the tower. The disadvantage is thatshaft20is too long.FIG. 7Bfeatures a vertical-axis wind turbine. Everything else is the same as inFIG. 7A.FIGS. 8A & 8Bshow abuilding28utilizing the system of the present invention. InFIG. 8Asaidbuilding28is transparent and we can see the system of the present invention installed inside. Specifically the embodiment ofFIG. 7Bof a vertical-axis wind turbine is presented but any of the embodiments of the present invention could be utilized. On the top of the building there is a vertical-axis propeller withblades3, thehub4and theshaft20. All of them form the rotor which via saidshaft20transfers its rotation, when there is wind, to thepump22. Said pump lifts water from thelower reservoir11into theupper container12. Said water then runs downconduit16and by turning the hydro-turbine17and thegenerator18produces electricity for the consumption of the building. If there is an excess of electricity it might be delivered back to the utility grid. Thus buildings with such systems could become partially or fully self sufficient in their own electric power consumption and can even produce electricity for outside use.On the middle or above the middle floors of the building, instead ofcontainer12, one or more floors could be used as water containers. Presently some tall buildings use one or more middle floors as water containers for a better stability in case of an earthquake. It has been tested that in case of an earthquake middle floors accommodating such water tanks absorb the vibrations of the quake and the buildings emerge stronger afterwards. In the present invention water inside the middle or top floors may serve both purposes. At the same time such floors with water container could be connected to water sprinklers and could be useful in case of fire.FIG. 9Ashows arotor assembly4of a horizontal-axis wind turbine with bladesreinforcement support attachments29a,29band29cand atower1. These blades reinforcement support elements consist of rods of equal size made of rigid hard material such as plastic, wood or metal. They could be flat, round or square tubes withholes30a,30band30cat each end for bolting them to the blades. The supports rods are fixedly attached to the blades with bolts going through the blades via holes exactly in the axial middle of the blades. All the holes should be exactly on the same place on each blade so that the blade's assembly is evenly balanced. If necessary, support rods may be attached to both sides of the blades and fastened with the same bolts. Blades reinforcements are necessary in case of strong and gusty winds to support the blades and protect them from bending, breaking or falling apart. The blades of the present invention will occasionally turn with speeds higher then normal and if they are not reinforced and properly balanced the whole assembly may begin wobbling and then break apart from the tower. That's why it is extremely important that these reinforcement rods are of equal size and that they are attached exactly in the axial middle of each blade. However, this type of support could only be installed on a fixed blade rotor because once they are installed said blades cannot pivot like the blades of a pitch-control rotor assembly.FIG. 9Bshows a side view of the blades assembly with the support rods ofFIG. 9A.FIG. 9Cshows a side view of the blades assembly with double-sided support rods.FIG. 9Dshows anextended rotor assembly4ofFIG. 9Bor9C withadditional rods31a,31b&31con the outer side, made of rigid hard material or of steel cables of equal size, angularly and fixedly attached on its one end to each one blade or to the rods ofFIG. 9Bor9C and on its other end to the rotor shaft of said wind turbine.

After the tower is erected, the different components, because of their smaller size, could be installed through the inside of the tower. A temporarilylattice construction33is build on the top of the tower and different components, like thegenerator9on the picture, are tied up with a metal rope or a cable and lifted to the top. After all components are installed the temporarily construction on the top could be removed. This method will enable a more economical construction of wind turbines because the need for a crane or other lifting equipment will be eliminated. It will reduce the overall cost of building a wind turbine. It will also enable a construction of turbines in remote locations where the access for big cranes is either limited or impossible.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/845,094, filed Aug. 27, 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,257,019 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by this reference, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. provisional application No. 60/871,135, filed Dec. 21, 2006, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by this reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention generally relates to devices for use in producing electric power from wind energy, and more particularly, to an elevated shrouded wind turbine adapted for yaw movement facing the wind.BACKGROUNDMost electricity today is generated by burning fossil fuels and producing steam which is then used drive a steam turbine that, in turn, drives an electrical generator. Unfortunately, however, the world's supply of fossil fuels is large, but finite. Exhaustion of low-cost fossil fuels will have significant consequences for energy sources as well as for the manufacture of plastics and many other things.More serious are concerns about the emissions that result from fossil fuel burning. Fossil fuels constitute a significant repository of carbon buried deep under the ground. Burning them results in the conversion of this carbon to carbon dioxide, which is then released into the atmosphere. This results in an increase in the Earth's levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which enhances the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. Depending upon the particular fossil fuel and the method of burning, other emissions may be produced as well. Ozone, SO2, NO2and other gases are often released, as well as particulate matter. Sulfur and nitrogen oxides contribute to smog and acid rain. Fossil fuels, particularly coal, also contain dilute radioactive material, and burning them in very large quantities releases this material into the environment, leading to low but real levels of local and global radioactive contamination. Coal also contains traces of toxic heavy elements such as mercury, arsenic and others. Mercury vaporized in a power plant's boiler may stay suspended in the atmosphere and circulate around the world.An alternative source of renewable energy, solar cells, also referred to as photovoltaic cells, use the photovoltaic effect of semiconductors to generate electricity directly from sunlight. Their use has been rather limited because of high manufacturing costs. Disadvantageously, the manufacturing process also consumes considerable fossil fuels, resulting in pollution. Additionally, refined silicon required for the semiconductors is in short supply, making solar cells relatively costly. Solar electricity currently tends to be more expensive than electricity generated by other sources. Furthermore, solar energy is not available at night, may be unavailable due to weather conditions, and may be compromised during winter months; therefore, a storage or complementary power system is required for most applications.Moreover, solar energy is inefficient. Expensive solar cells made from single crystal silicon are currently limited to about 25% efficiency because they are most sensitive to infrared light, and radiation in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum is relatively low in energy. Polycrystalline solar cells are made by a casting process in which molten silicon is poured into a mould and allowed to cool, then sliced into wafers. This process results in cells that are significantly less expensive to produce than single crystal cells, but whose efficiency is limited to less than 20% due to internal resistance at the boundaries of the silicon crystals. Amorphous cells are made by depositing silicon onto a glass substrate from a reactive gas such as silane (SiH4). This type of solar cell can be applied as a thin film to low cost substrates such as glass or plastic. Thin film cells have a number of advantages, including easier deposition and assembly, the ability to be deposited on inexpensive substrates, the ease of mass production, and the high suitability to large applications. Since amorphous silicon cells have no crystal structure at all, their efficiencies are presently only about 10% due to significant internal energy losses.Another attractive alternative source of renewable energy, wind power, produces electricity from the flow of air over the surface of the earth. Wind rotates a rotor mechanically to an electric generator to produce electricity. Unlike solar cells, properly located wind turbines can generate the energy used in its construction within just months of operation. Greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution produced by construction of a wind turbine are small and declining. There are no emissions or pollution produced by operation of a wind turbine. Modern wind turbines are almost silent and rotate so slowly (in terms of revolutions per minute) that they are rarely a serious hazard to birds. Aesthetic, landscape and heritage issues may be a significant issue for certain wind farms. However, when appropriate planning procedures are followed, these risks are minimal and should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.Unfortunately, conventional wind turbines suffer several serious shortcomings. For example, they rely exclusively on ambient wind speed. Nothing is done to accelerate the wind and thereby attempt to improve efficiency of the turbine. Known prior art wind energy systems do not include a shroud.Another shortcoming is serviceability. Conventional rotors, blades and adjacent components are unreachable from the tower for maintenance. Mechanisms configured to retract the rotor towards a tower, or a yaw assembly configured to facilitate rotational movement of the shroud and rotor to face oncoming wind.Yet another shortcoming is the stationary structure supporting the nacelle. While many wind turbines include yaw mechanisms to orient the nacelle into the wind, no prior art wind turbine rotates the structure supporting the nacelle. Thus the structure is stationary and typically designed with a circular or similar cross section, which exhibits similar aerodynamic properties from every angle. Such designs exhibit marginal aerodynamic performance, making the structure more prone to drag and susceptible to failure than a streamlined structure.Still another shortcoming of conventional wind turbines is the required blade size to drive a particular generator. As conventional wind turbines do nothing to augment wind speed, power requirements are met by sizing the rotor. A large generator, of course, requires substantial power provided by a large rotor to turn. This approach ignores the relationship of wind speed to power, whereby an increased wind speed augments power output. Disadvantageously, a larger rotor increases manufacturing and construction costs, stresses on the support structure, wear and tear on bearings, and maintenance costs.The invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems and solving one or more of the needs as set forth above.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONTo solve one or more of the problems set forth above, in an exemplary implementation of the invention a wind energy systems is provided with a shroud for each turbine. The shroud is adapted to direct and accelerate wind towards the turbine.In one aspect of the invention, an exemplary wind turbine system includes a shroud having an entrance, throat and exit, the entrance having an entrance diameter, the throat having a throat diameter and the exit having an exit diameter, wherein the entrance diameter is greater than throat diameter. A rotor assembly includes a hub and a plurality of blades attached to the hub. The rotor assembly has a diameter less than the throat diameter and is centered at the throat of the shroud. The rotor assembly is configured to convert wind energy into rotary mechanical movement of the rotor assembly. The rotor assembly is operably coupled to a nacelle, which includes an electric generator configured to produce electric power from rotary mechanical movement. In a preferred embodiment, the plurality of blades consists of five identical blades equally spaced on the hub seventy two degrees apart. The throat diameter is 2% to 20% larger than the diameter of the diameter of the rotor assembly, allowing rotation and deflection of the rotor assembly without contact between the blades and shroud. The transition from inlet diameter to throat diameter is smooth and gradual, with a shroud pitch of 15 degrees to 60 degrees. The shroud receives wind and accelerates the received wind to a throat wind velocity, of 1.25 to 2.5 times the entrance wind velocity. A support structure supports the nacelle, rotor assembly and shroud. Each of the plurality of blades has a twist of approximately 15° to 25°, with a pitch that varies from 1° to 5° near the tip to 15° to 25° near the root, and a chord length that tapers about 75% to 33% from the root the tip.In another aspect of the invention, a horizontal actuator for moving the nacelle is provided. The nacelle is operably coupled to the horizontal actuator and the horizontal actuator is operably coupled to the support structure. The horizontal actuator is adapted to controllably move the nacelle from a deployed operational position to a retracted maintenance position.In a further aspect of the invention a yaw system is provided to rotate the rotor assembly, support structure and nacelle. The support structure is mounted atop the yaw system. The yaw system may include an air glide bearing turntable, a gearbox, a drive gear, and a motor. The motor drives the gear box, which drives the drive gear, which drives the turntable. A central air chamber sandwiched between the air glide bearing turntable and the base is adapted to receive pressurized gas with a lubricant sufficient to exert an upward force equal to 0.5 to 1.5 times a weight of the air glide bearing turntable plus the weight supported by the air glide bearing turntable. A gasket may be sandwiched between the air glide bearing turntable and the base. The gasket is a low friction polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based gasket.In yet another aspect of the invention the generator includes a servo motor with a position encoder. The position encoder produces output signals corresponding to position of the input shaft. A speedup assembly has a speedup input shaft and an output speedup shaft. The output speedup shaft is adapted to rotate at about 1,500 rpm when the speedup input shaft rotates at about 30 to 60 rpm. The output speedup shaft is coupled to the motor input shaft.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe foregoing and other aspects, objects, features and advantages of the invention will become better understood with reference to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings, where:FIG. 1is a front plan view of an exemplary wind turbine, without a shroud, adapted for controlled yaw movement according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 2is a profile view of an exemplary wind turbine, without a shroud, adapted for controlled yaw movement according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 2Ais an profile view of an exemplary mechanical actuator assembly adapted for linearly moving the nacelle from an operational use position to a maintenance position according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 3is a top plan view of an exemplary wind turbine, without a shroud, adapted for yaw movement facing the wind according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 4is a top plan view of an exemplary tower yaw assembly adapted for yaw movement according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 4Ais a section view of an exemplary tower yaw assembly adapted for yaw movement according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 5is an exploded profile view of an exemplary nacelle assembly according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 6is a front plan view of an exemplary wind turbine, with a shroud, adapted for controlled yaw movement according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 6Ais a profile view of an exemplary wind turbine, with a shroud, adapted for controlled yaw movement according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 6Bis a profile view of an exemplary shroud with velocity vectors to conceptually illustrate how the shroud affects wind speed according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 7is a front plan view of a first exemplary truss support assembly according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 7Ais a profile view of a first exemplary truss support assembly according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 8is a front plan view of a second exemplary truss support assembly according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 8Ais a profile view of a second exemplary truss support assembly according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 9is a front plan view of a third exemplary truss support assembly according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 9Ais a profile view of a third exemplary truss support assembly according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 10Ais a front plan view of an exemplary concrete support structure supporting a framework comprising a plurality of wind turbines, each with a shroud, wherein the framework is adapted for controlled yaw movement according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 10Bis a side plan view of an exemplary concrete support structure supporting a framework comprising a plurality of wind turbines, each with a shroud, wherein the framework is adapted for controlled yaw movement according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 11is a side plan view and section views of an exemplary blade according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 12Ais a top plan view and section views of an exemplary blade according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 12Bis a side plan view and section views of an exemplary blade according to principles of the invention; andFIG. 12Cis a side plan view and section views of an exemplary blade according to principles of the invention.Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the figures are not intended to be drawn to any particular scale; nor are the figures intended to illustrate every embodiment of the invention. The invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments depicted in the figures or the shapes, relative sizes, ornamental aspects or proportions shown in the figures.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONReferring to the Figures, in which like parts are indicated with the same reference numerals, various views of exemplary wind turbine systems and assemblies and components thereof according to principles of the invention are shown. An exemplary wind turbine system according to principles of the invention includes a tower construction, a yaw drive assembly, a shroud, a rotor with rotor blades, a nacelle with a drive train and miscellaneous components.A foundation (not shown in the drawings) anchors the system to the ground. In order to guarantee stability, one or more piles and/or a flat foundation may be used, depending on the consistency of the underlying ground. A flat foundation comprises a large reinforced concrete slab which forms the footing of the generator. In a pile foundation, foundation plates (plate foundations) are fixed with piles into the earth. This is particularly necessary in soft subsoil.A tower construction, exemplary embodiments of which are described below, carries the weight of the supported equipment, such as thesupport frame120,nacelle115androtor blades105, while withstanding the huge static loads caused by the varying power of the wind. The tower construction elevates the system to a desired height, e.g., thirty feet or more above ground level. A tower construction of concrete, steel or other building materials may be used. The tower construction may be a containment structure suitable for housing equipment, a lattice or truss assembly, or other suitable stable form. In the case of concrete, the tower may be constructed on site, which simplifies transport and fitting. Alternatively, pre-cast concrete segments may be shipped and assembled on site.Referring toFIGS. 1,2and3, front plan, profile and top plan views of anexemplary wind turbine110, without a shroud, adapted for controlled yaw movement according to principles of the invention are shown. A support structure, e.g.,support frame120, is mounted on aturntable130of ayaw drive assembly135, controllably driven by amotor125. Anacelle115and rotor assembly, which comprises ahub580and plurality (e.g., five) ofrotor blades105, are supported by theframe120. Themotor125may be manually actuated by a switch and/or automatically operated using a programmable logic controller, microcontroller or other control means, to maintain in a direction facing the wind.In the exemplary embodiment, theframe120is comprised of a framework of beams forming a rigid A-shaped support structure. However, the invention is not limited to such a support frame. Any structure suitable for supporting thenacelle115and rotor assembly on theyaw drive assembly135may be utilized and comes within the scope of the invention. Such structures may, for example, include tubular steel, concrete post and lattice structures.The rotor assembly, with the help of therotor blades105, converts the energy in the wind into rotary mechanical movement. In an exemplary implementation, a five-blade, horizontal axis rotor assembly is utilized. Therotor blades105may be comprised of fiber reinforced (e.g., glass, aramid or carbon-fiber reinforced) plastics (GRP, CFRP), aluminum, alloys, combinations thereof, or other suitable material. The blade profile (airfoil shape) is similar to that of an aircraft wing and uses the same aerodynamic principles to generate lift, which cause the rotor to rotate.The rotor comprisesmultiple rotor blades105attached to a hub580(FIG. 5). The rotor converts the wind energy into a rotation. In an exemplary embodiment, the rotor has five blades, a horizontal axis, and a diameter of approximately fifteen (15) feet or more. The use of five (5)rotor blades105allows for a better distribution of mass than conventional two (2) or three (3) blade designs, which makes rotation smoother. A five (5) blade design also allows a smaller diameter, than conventional two (2) or three (3) blade designs that produce similar forces.Thehub580is the center of the rotor assembly to which therotor blades105are attached. Thehub580directs the energy from therotor blades105on to the generator. If the wind turbine has a gearbox, thehub580is connected to the gearbox shaft, converting the energy from the wind into rotation energy. If the turbine has a direct drive, thehub580passes the energy directly to a ring generator. Eachrotor blade115can be attached to thehub580in various ways: either in a fixed position or with pitch adjustment. Afixed hub580is sturdy, reduces the number of movable components that can fail, and is relatively easy to construct. Pitch adjustment enables manual or remote adjustment of blade pitch to improve efficiency.Thehub580thus locates and captures the fiverotor blades105. Thehub580correctly positions therotor blades105for correct tilt and angular placement. The blades are locked in position using heavy duty mechanical clamps and a locking pin. The locking pin uses two hardened pins locating in a recess in the rotor blade and further locating in thehub580to provide positive locking. The blades can be manually adjusted for pitch in thehub580.In a preferred embodiment, eachindividual rotor blade115can be infinitely adjusted manually, electromechanically or hydraulically, by turning into or out of the wind. In such an embodiment, the rotor blades may be positioned at a pitch angle suitable for generating acceptable lift, such as maximum lift, at a design wind speed (e.g., average prevailing local wind speed for the location of the turbine).Alternatively, eachindividual rotor blade115can be adjusted automatically. Actuators for automated or remote pitch adjustment may be either hydraulic or electromechanical. In an automated embodiment, a controller monitors the turbine's power output and/or rotational speed. If the wind is too strong, therotor blades105may be pitched slightly to reduce lift, so that the rotor continues to generate power at rated capacity even at high wind speeds. Otherwise, the system may maintain the rotor blades at a pitch angle suitable for generating acceptable lift, such as maximum lift, for the design or detected wind speed.Referring now toFIGS. 2 and 2A, an exemplaryhorizontal actuator assembly205adapted for linearly moving thenacelle115from an operational use position to amaintenance position230according to principles of the invention is shown. The nacelle is operably coupled to the horizontal actuator and the horizontal actuator is operably coupled to the support structure. The horizontal actuator is adapted to controllably move the nacelle from a deployed operational position to a retracted maintenance position. Any manual or automatic linear actuator suitable for reliably moving thenacelle115may be utilized. By way of example and not limitation, in an exemplary embodiment, theactuator assembly205includes a hand wheel with ahandle210operably coupled to a rotatable threadedlead screw220. The leadscrew is screw specialized for the purpose of translating rotational to linear motion. The mechanical advantage of a leadscrew is determined by the screw pitch or lead. A higher performing, and more expensive, alternative is a ball screw comprising a threaded shaft that provides a spiral raceway for ball bearings which act as a precision screw. Due to inherently high static friction, the lead screw is self-locking (i.e., when stopped, a linear force on the nut will not apply a torque to the screw) thus avoiding backdriving. A threaded flange215(e.g., a flange with a threaded nut) coupled to thenacelle115by acradle225receives thelead screw220. The threadedflange215threadedly travels along the length of thelead screw220as the lead screw is rotated, thereby causing thecradle225to glide in a clamp rail, and consequently cause thenacelle115to move linearly and horizontally. The lead screw is rotatably fixed to thesupport frame120. Aside from rotational motion, thelead screw220does not move relative to thesupport frame120. The range of motion of the nacelle extends from a deployed operation position to a retractedmaintenance position230. In themaintenance position230, therotor blades105are closest to and accessible from thesupport frame120. In the deployed position, therotor blades105are furthest from thesupport frame120. Thus, thenacelle115may be driven from a deployed position to a retractedmaintenance position230by rotating the hand wheel with ahandle210. Other means for controlled horizontal linear movement of the nacelle, including (without imitation) hydraulic, pneumatic and electromechanical actuators, also come within the scope of the invention.To ensure maximum power output from the generator, a wind turbine according to principles of the invention is equipped with ayaw system400, as shown inFIGS. 4 and 4A. Theyaw system400may also be used to better position the rotor assembly and nacelle at a position for servicing. Theyaw system400allows the rotor assembly, nacelle and support frame to rotate (i.e., yaw) to face wind. Theexemplary yaw system400comprises an airglide bearing turntable445, agearbox415, a drive gear405(e.g., pinion gear) on abearing425, and an electric motor410(e.g., a servo motor controlled via a communicatively coupled PLC) as a prime mover, i.e., the ultimate source of all mechanical movement in the system. A mechanical or hydraulic braking system may be provided to prevent drift and lock the turntable securely in position when there is no yaw operation. The yaw system is mounted beneath the support frame, and may be mounted atop a tower. Themotor410drives thegear box415, which drives thedrive gear405. Thedrive gear405meshes, with gear teeth of abull gear445coupled to the circumference of theturntable445. Thus, rotation of thedrive gear405causes rotation of theturntable445. Theturntable445is rotatably supported atop a yawassembly support base430between a plurality ofroller bearings440. Theroller bearings440maintain theturntable445in proper radial alignment with thepinion gear405and limit upward movement of theturntable445to prevent separation of theturntable445from thebase430.To greatly facilitate rotation, the exemplary yaw system includes an air glide bearing subsystem. The air glide bearing subsystem comprises acentral air chamber435sandwiched between theturntable445andbase430. Agasket420is sandwiched between the flanged periphery of theturntable445and thebase430. Compressed air with a lubricant may be pumped into thechamber435through an inlet port at a pressure (e.g., about 100 psi) sufficient to exert a substantial upward force, e.g., 0.5 to 1.5 the total supported weight, including the weight of the turntable. In a preferred implementation, the upward force is less than the supported weight (e.g., sum total weight of the turntable, frame, nacelle and rotor assembly), but is sufficient to offset the supported weight enough to greatly facilitate rotation without breaking the seal maintained by thegasket420between theturntable445and thebase430. In a preferred embodiment, one layer or a plurality (e.g., 2 or more) layers of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based gasket, such as a PTFE tape impregnated with brass or bronze (e.g., Garlock® #426 Multifil Bearing Tape), may be utilized, to maintain a high integrity low friction seal. The airglide bearing assembly400thus floats while controlled motion is supplied via a motor.In an exemplary embodiment a servo motor with a 2:1 belt reduction drives a 60:1 dodge worm gear further reduced 18:1. Thus, every 6 turns of the servo motor provides 11 of rotation of the turntable. At 2,160 rpm, the servo motor will rotate the turntable 360° in one minute.Thenacelle115holds turbine machinery, as shown in the exemplary exploded view ofFIG. 5. In the exemplary embodiment, anacorn nut590secures aspinner110to aspinner standoff585.Hex safety bolts505lock blades105to thehub580. Ablade clamp510with a retainingpin520is secured to thehub580by ahex safety bolt515. The hub is coupled to the input shaft of a speedup assembly560(i.e., a gearbox) via aspindle565with a retainingpin525spindle keeper570andhead cap screw575. Abushing535,head cap screw530and nut are provided to couple thecradle225to thespeedup assembly560. Acoupling540joins the keyed output shaft of thespeedup assembly560to the keyed input shaft of theturbine assembly550. Theturbine assembly550employs an integral servo motor, position encoder and brake in one complete package. The integral motor design assures maximum efficiency, while keeping the overall footprint sleek and out of the air flow. A head cap screw connects thecradle225to theturbine assembly550. For some embodiments, an asynchronous generator may be used. Other embodiments may use a synchronous generator. A grid connection of synchronous generator is made via a transformer, due to the fixed rotation behavior.Thespeedup assembly560takes on the task of matching the rotation speeds of the slow-moving rotor and the fast-moving generator. By way of example, thespeedup assembly560increases the rotation speed from 30 to 60 rpm (which is insufficient for producing electrical energy) to 1,500 rpm. Thepreferred speedup assembly560has gears generally in parallel on the input side and a planetary gear stage on the output side, thereby using fewer rotating components than a conventional system and reduces mechanical stresses and at the same time increases the technical service life of the equipment.Advantageously, a wind turbine system according to principles of the invention may utilize conventional commercially available electronic equipment, including a generator, a system for grid in-feed of the electricity, and various sensors and controls. The system for feeding electricity into the grid depends upon the generator used. In a variable speed turbine embodiment with a synchronous generator, alternating current generated fluctuates constantly in frequency and quantity. In order for the electricity to be fed into the grid, it is converted into direct current using a rectifier, filtered and then converted back into alternating current using an inverter. Voltage is converted for connection to the level of the grid using a transformer. Sensors for monitoring and control may be provided on and in thenacelle115to measure wind speed and wind direction, speed of the rotors and the generator, the ambient temperature and temperature of individual components, oil pressure, pitch and azimuth angle (yaw mechanism based on the wind direction) and electrical values, as well as vibrations or vibrations in thenacelle115. Data from sensor signals may be used to control operation. For example, in response to signals corresponding to wind direction, the yaw mechanism may be activated. An exemplary wind turbine system according to principles of the invention may also contain components lighting, cooling, heating, lightning protection, lifting gear (e.g. winches for spare parts), communications equipment and fire extinguishing equipment.The nacelle may optionally include temperature control features. The temperatures inside anacelle115can be quite high due to the waste heat from the speedup assembly and the generator. Cooling elements such as heat sinks, fans and vents may therefore be installed in thenacelle115to help keep it cool. Heaters may also be provided to warm up the oil in the gearbox in cold climates.Rotor blades105may be heated in cold climate conditions to prevent them from icing over. Anemometers and weather vanes may also be heated in cold regions to prevent them from malfunctioning.Referring now toFIGS. 6 and 6A, front plan and profile views of an exemplary wind turbine, with a shroud, adapted for controlled yaw movement according to principles of the invention are shown. Theshroud600comprises a forward entrance-definingportion605, acenter throat portion610and a rear exit-definingportion615, with the inner surfaces of all three portions defining a circular passageway, and with each section differing in radius. Thus, the shroud comprises an axisymmetric tubular structure, converging to a minimum radius in the middle, making somewhat of an hourglass-shape, with a smooth bell shaped venturi inlet, a circular throat, and a flared exit. The diameter of the inlet, di, is larger than the throat diameter, dt. The diameter of the exit, de, is also larger than the throat diameter, dt, but equal to or less than the diameter of the inlet, di. The diameter of thethroat610of the shroud, dt, is slightly larger (e.g., 2% to 20% larger) than the diameter of the rotor assembly with the blades, thereby enabling the rotor with blades to be positioned in or nearby (e.g., at or slightly aft of) the throat section and allowing blade rotation and deflection without scraping or otherwise contacting the interior surface of the shroud. By way of example and not limitation, for a rotor with blades having a diameter of 15 feet, the shroud may feature a throat diameter, dt, of about 17 feet, an inlet diameter, di, of about 25 feet, and an exit diameter, de, of about 20 feet. In general, the larger the ratio of inlet diameter to throat diameter, i.e., di/dt, the greater the increase in wind speed.To provide a smooth transition from ambient wind speed Vito throat wind speed Vt, the transition from inlet diameter, di, to throat diameter, dt, should be smooth and gradual. Discontinuities and sudden changes in diameter facilitate early transition from laminar to undesired turbulent flow. Turbulent flow, is dominated by recirculation, eddies, unsteady vortices, increased drag due to increased boundary layer skin friction, and chaos, including low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time. Thus turbulence compromises wind speed at the throat, Vt, and decreases overall system performance and efficiency.To militate against the onset of turbulence, in an exemplary embodiment, the transition from inlet diameter, di, to throat diameter, dt, occurs over a minimum shroud inlet length, li, equal to about 25% to 75% of the difference between inlet diameter, di, and throat diameter, dt. Thus, the minimum length increases as the difference between the inlet diameter, di, and throat diameter, dtincreases. In a particular exemplary embodiment, for a shroud tapering from a 25 foot inlet diameter, di, to a 17 foot throat diameter, dt, a minimum shroud inlet length, li, equal to about 50% of the difference between inlet diameter, di, and throat diameter, dt, i.e., 4 feet which is 50% of 8 feet, is preferred. In such an exemplary embodiment, a transition length liof 4 feet or greater (e.g., 4.75 feet) may be used. This gradual tapering results in an acute shroud pitch, α, preferably less than 60°.In addition, the transition to and from the throat diameter d.sub.t is smooth, gradual and curvaceous. Illustratively, the throat may feature a curved section having a radius, rt, of approximately 25% to 65% of the total shroud length, li+le, and a center of curvature in line with the throat, as shown inFIG. 6A. In a particular exemplary embodiment, for a shroud with a total length of approximately 7 feet, a radius of curvature, rt, for the throat section of approximately 2 feet may be provided.Likewise, the transition from throat diameter, dt, to exit diameter, de, should be gradual to avoid low speed transition from laminar to undesired turbulent flow dominated by recirculation, eddies and unsteady vortices. Such flow, characterized by swirling and reverse current, can offset the benefit of the accelerated incoming flow and decrease overall system performance and efficiency. In an exemplary embodiment, the transition from throat diameter, dt, to exit diameter, de, occurs over a minimum shroud exit length, le, equal to about 25% to 85% of the difference between exit diameter, de, and throat diameter, dt. Thus, the minimum length increases as the difference between the exit diameter, de, and throat diameter, dtincreases. In a particular exemplary embodiment, for a shroud expanding from a 17 foot throat diameter, dt, to a 20 foot exit diameter, de, a minimum shroud exit length, le, equal to about 75% of the difference between exit diameter, di, and throat diameter, dt, i.e., 2.25 feet which is 50% of 8 feet, may be used.Theshroud600accelerates the flow of air passing through it. The speed of air increases as it moves from the wide entrance through the converging portion leading to the narrow throat. At or near the throat, the air velocity reaches a maximum. As the shroud cross sectional area gradually diverges from the narrow throat to the wider exit, the air expands, decelerates and exits.FIG. 6Bis a profile view of an exemplary shroud with velocity vectors to conceptually illustrate how the shroud affects wind speed according to principles of the invention. As discussed above, the shroud amplifies or increases velocity of wind driving the rotor blades. Wind flow approaches the shroud at a velocity Vi. As the wind travels through the entrance of the shroud and approaches the throat, it is compressed and accelerates to Vt. The wind velocity at the throat, Vt, is greater than the entrance velocity Vi, by a factor x, which is greater than 1.0 (e.g., 1.25 to 2.5). In a particular exemplary embodiment, x is approximately 2, meaning that wind velocity at the throat, Vt, is about twice the entrance velocity Vi. As wind power is cubically related to wind speed, a two-fold increase in wind velocity results in an eight-fold increase in energy output. Rotor blades located at or near the throat of the shroud will be subject to the higher wind velocity, thus increasing the rotational speed of the rotor. The gradual transition or expansion of air passing out to the atmosphere serves to avoid turbulence and reduce aerodynamic losses.Referring now toFIGS. 7,7A,8,8A and9various optional exemplary truss support tower assemblies according to principles of the invention are conceptually shown. The assemblies comprise a lattice framework of crisscrossed support members and surrounding beams. Each truss support tower assembly includes one or more elevatingsections710,810,920and one or moreelevated sections705,805,905-915configured to support one or more rotors, shrouds600and nacelles. The entire truss support tower assembly may be mounted atop and configured for yaw motion on a yaw assembly, such as the yaw assembly described above. Alternatively, each elevated section may be mounted atop and configured for yaw motion on a yaw assembly.Of course, other support towers may be utilized. As one example, aconcrete tower assembly1000featuring a concrete tower, such as a 60 feet tall 15 feetdiameter concrete tower1005, as shown inFIG. 10, may be provided to elevate the system to a desired height, e.g., thirty feet or more above ground level. Thetower1005may be a containment structure suitable for housing equipment. Thetower1005may be constructed on site, which simplifies transport and fitting. Alternatively, pre-cast concrete segments may be shipped and assembled on site. Anentrance door1015is provided in the exemplary embodiment, to allow access to the interior by personnel and equipment. The one or morewind turbine systems1020, including ayaw assembly1010, may be supported on the roof of thetower construction1005. Access to the roof may be provided through a suitable opening such as a doorway, trap door, ladder or other access means.Referring now toFIG. 11, a side plan view and section views of an exemplary,scalable blade1100according to principles of the invention are shown. The blade is not limited to the dimensions or proportions shown. The mountingshaft1105is received by the hub of the rotor. The cross section profiles (views AA at 19.50 inches from the end of the mounting shaft, BB at 36.38 inches from the end of the mounting shaft, CC at 52.25 inches from the end of the mounting shaft, DD at 68.12 inches from the end of the mounting shaft and EE at 85.03 inches from the end of the mounting shaft) are designed to give low drag and good lift. The pitch of the cross section profiles varies from 2° near the tip (as in view EE) to 20° near the root (as in view AA), providing an overall twist of about 18°. In an exemplary embodiment a twist of approximately 15° to 25° is preferred. The twist, results in a change in the true angle of attack for the airfoil that depends on the radial location, allowing more pitch at the blade root for easier startup, and less pitch at the tip for better high-speed performance. The length of the chord, c, changes (i.e., tapers) about of about 75% to 33% along the length of the blade, from a maximum near the root (i.e., section AA having a chord of about 19.85 inches) to a minimum near the tip (i.e., section EE having a chord of about 12 inches). The airfoil shaped blade, with a rounded leading edge and sharp trailing edge, twist of approximately 15° to 25° produces lift when placed in a wind stream, and taper of about 60%. By way of example and not limitation, a blade may have a twist of approximately 15° to 25°, with a pitch that varies from 1° to 5° near the tip to 15° to 25° near the root, and a chord length that tapers about 75% to 33% from the root the tip.Referring now toFIGS. 12A and 12B, top and side plan views of theuncovered spar1200over which a skin is formed to create a blade are shown. The spar comprises a thickleading edge stringer1205that terminates at the root with a mountingshaft1105. A plurality ofribs1215, anangled root stringer1225and awing tip1230join a thintrailing edge stringer1220to theleading edge stringer1205.The spar is filled with foam and a skin is formed over the foam filled structure to form theblade1200, as shown in the top plan view ofFIG. 12C. The skin is preferably a fiber reinforced (e.g., glass, aramid or carbon-fiber reinforced) plastic. The spar is preferably aluminum or an aluminum alloy.Preferably, wind turbines are positioned to face into the prevailing wind. In some applications, a wind turbine according to principles of the invention may use a non-rotatable, fixed base, where prevailing winds consistently blow from the same direction.While an exemplary embodiment of the invention has been described, it should be apparent that modifications and variations thereto are possible, all of which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.

No. 8,030,790, granted on Oct. 4, 2011.TECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates generally to the field of alternative energy generating wind turbines used for generating electricity, and more specifically to hybrid water pressure energy accumulating wind turbine towers modified for storing water as potential energy for immediate or later use as electric energy and for transmission over the grid. The above disclosure sets forth a number of embodiments of the present invention. Other arrangements or embodiments, not precisely set forth, could be practiced under the teaching of the present invention and as set forth in the following claims.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNatural energy is available throughout the world in various forms such as wind, solar, tidal and wave energy. Wind turbines have been used for production of electricity although such use has typically been limited to the production of small amounts of direct current (DC) electricity.Conventional sources of energy for the production of electricity are in an ever-dwindling supply, which necessitates that natural forms of energy be utilized to a greater extent. The natural forms of energy are effectively inexhaustible and are typically available in different forms throughout the world.The first machine to generate electricity from wind was designed and built in Denmark in 1890. Subsequently, several hundred machines were built in that country.In the United States, wind machines were widely used to generate electricity in rural areas until the 1930's, providing farmers with electricity, when the US Congress enacted the Rural Electrification Act, which effectively electrified the country.In 1931, in the (then) Soviet Union, the first relatively large wind turbine of 100-kilowatt capacity was built.In 1941, in the United States, a 1,250-kilowatt wind machine was designed and built. Shortly after beginning the operation, a main bearing and a blade failed. Because of World War II, the machine was never repaired and it was subsequently dismantled.Today wind turbines for producing electricity are widely used in some countries. In 2007 Germany was a leading power in wind energy production followed by USA:1. Germany—22.248 MW, 2. USA—16.818 MW, 3. Spain—15.145 MW, 4. India—8.000 MW, 5. China—6.050 MW.In 2008 the leading German firm Enercon began installation of the world's largest wind turbine Enercon E-126 with a power of 6-megawatt(MW) which is enough to supply electricity to 4,500.-homes. The diameter of the rotor of E-126 is 126 meters. The weight of the nacelle (gondola) is 75 tons. The tower is almost 200 meters tall. For comparison, the Eiffel tower is 300 meters tall.Today most of the contemporary machines in the world are of the horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) type; only less than 10% are of the vertical-axis (VAWT) type.Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical power through the use of a rotor that spins a shaft. The shaft is connected to a generator that converts the mechanical power into electricity.The horizontal-axis type machines, in addition to the tower and the foundation include:Blades which consist of aluminum reinforced with fiberglass. They have a heavy composite cross section which now reaches 8 cm for 2 to 3 MW production machines.A hub which connects the blades to the low-speed shaft. The hub transmits the torque developed by the rotor blades to the shaft.A pitch-control assembly for tilting the blades in the hub in order to properly adjust them to the so-called “angle of attack” of the wind. This means that the total surface area of the blade's assembly facing the wind changes. When the wind is weak, the surface gets bigger. When the wind is strong, each blade turns on its base and the total surface area gets smaller to reduce the wind pressure in order for the blade assembly to rotate with a constant speed.A brake designed to stop the spinning main shaft in case of high winds. Usually a disc brake, similar to the one in automobiles.A gearbox that converts the shaft's high-torque low-speed motion into low-torque high-speed motion that fits the electric generator's requirement. The shaft rotates on average at about 12 to 22 rpm while the generator requires approximately 1,800 rpm.A generator, whose function is to convert the shaft torque into electricity.A nacelle consisting of a cabin that houses all of the above mentioned elements. In modern turbines the nacelle is often of the size of a school bus or bigger. The nacelle sits atop a tower, such as a tubular steel or concrete tower or a lattice tower. Presently there is a trend is to use taller towers because the wind energy typically exponentially increases with the height.A yaw assembly whose function is to support the entire machine assembly inside the nacelle on top of the tower and to permit its rotation for alignment with the wind.This clearly illustrates that converting wind energy directly into electricity utilizing wind turbines involves elaborate equipment and requires high initial costs.Prior Technology:As the need for storing energy increased, in 1979 Hanley patented an invention in which wind energy is used to produce electricity that is used to lift water from downstream to upstream of a dam with a hydropower plant. The lifted water is stored as potential energy. Upon demand, the water is used to generate electricity.His invention addresses the problem of storing wind energy as water potential energy. However, it has the disadvantage of converting wind energy to hydraulic power. Therefore, Hanley's invention, assuming its technical feasibility, involves elaborate equipment and requires high initial costs.In an effort to make offshore wind power facilities even more reliable, Siemens Energy is now testing a new type of wind turbine that works without a gearbox. The main benefit of the new unit lies in its more simplified design, which requires fewer machine components, and will therefore result in lower maintenance costs and a higher level of reliability. This is especially important for offshore facilities, where turbine breakdowns are always very expensive.The first of the wind turbines without gearboxes has been erected in 2008 in western Denmark. This turbine has an output of 3.6 megawatts (MW). With a rotor diameter of 107 meters.The project is in a research phase for two years and will enable Siemens Energy to determine whether or not the units without gearboxes will be able to compete with conventional models and, if so, in which performance classes. Wind turbines without gearboxes are generally heavier than conventional units and also more expensive to produce.The units without gearboxes are instead equipped with synchronous generators that are stimulated by so-called permanent magnets. They directly convert the rotor's movements into electrical energy. The two generators in Denmark boost a torque of roughly 2,500 kilonewton-meters each. By comparison, a powerful electric drive system for a car has torque of significantly less than one kilonewton-meter.Deficiency of Prior Technology:The advantages of wind energy are that it is renewable, nonpolluting, and free.The disadvantages of wind energy are that it is diluted, unpredictable, and requires high initial costs. When wind is not blowing, the wind producing equipment sits idly by and there is no electricity. Wind energy is only available when the wind is blowing within a particular range of wind speeds, i.e., the turbine cannot operate at wind speeds (also called velocities) below the minimum speed and cannot safely operate above the maximum speed. Typically, the minimum speed is 7-8 km/h and the maximum speed is 60 km/h. Hence, the wind energy is only available intermittently. Further, wind power is dependent on the location because it is only seasonal in many areas of the world.The major disadvantages of the currently used wind turbines are:Each has its own electric generating equipment, a gearbox linked to an AC generator atop a tower. Electric equipment is very heavy and expensive and therefore initial cost is very high. Gearboxes for contemporary wind turbines are very big, heavy and expensive machineries. There are two more problems with them. Presently the market demand for them is too high and their availability is insufficient. The manufacturing capacity lags behind the demand about 2 years. And because said gearboxes and generators are big and heavy, it is difficult to lift them to the top of today's tall wind turbine towers. Also, because of their weight and size, the construction of the towers must be very robust. Another object of this invention is to eliminate them altogether in some specific embodiments.Each has its own pitch-control assembly. Some smaller turbines are without said assembly. They have a so-called fixed pitch wind turbine rotor. A fixed pitch wind turbine rotor is a simplification at a lower cost over that of a controllable blade pitch wind turbine rotor. However, a fixed pitch rotor is harder to start because the blade pitch for efficient operation is different from that for good starting. A proposed solution to bring the wind turbine rotor up to operating speed is to use its own generator as a motor during startup. A fixed pitch turbine rotor is designed to stall in high winds in order to limit rotor torque and not to damage the generator. This invention eliminates the pitch-control assembly.The machines are too big, tall and bulky. For example, on a large 5 MW turbine the blades alone could be over 18 tons even with the use of carbon fiber reinforcement. The blades diameter now reaches over 120 meters. The generator alone could be over 55 tons.The tall towers and blades up to 65 meters long are difficult to transport. Transportation can now cost 20% of equipment costs.In horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT), the electric generating equipment is installed atop the tower. The present day towers are very tall which makes installation difficult and sometime impossible in remote and high elevation locations because there are not adequate roads for big cranes to get there to deliver and install the heavy equipment. However, high elevations are the best for harvesting wind energy because of continuous high winds there. Besides the problems with installation, the operation and maintenance on the top of large towers is difficult. The blades are also subject to high vibrations during wind gusts and often bend or break apart. All of this shortens the equipment's life span.The majority of HAWTs use an upwind design, with the rotor facing the wind in front of the tower. Downwind variants suffer from fatigue and structural failure caused by turbulence when a blade passes through the tower's wind shadow.The electricity produced by the windmills must be consumed immediately. Usually wind blows harder at night, The demand for electricity at night is lowest. This creates an operational problem for the utility to whose grid the windmills are connected.When wind is not blowing, the entire system is not working and no electricity is produced.SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONIn the present invention the major difference from the prior art is the use of water tank reservoirs as pressure vessels for storing energy. This results in several advantages of cost and energy savings when compared to the use of standard wind turbines. At the same time water in these reservoirs could be used in times of dry periods for watering and other needs.It is an object of the present invention to reduce the cost of converting wind energy into electricity by directly coupling wind turbines with water pumps that will lift the water from lower elevation to higher elevation where it is stored as potential energy.Another object of the present invention is to utilize all wind potential, weak and strong and more remote and high location areas.Another object of the present invention is to utilize any type of windmill, vertical-axis or horizontal-axis.Another object of the present invention is to harness the wind energy in an economical way and to improve productivity and cost effectiveness of the wind turbines.Another object of the present invention is to utilize the advantages of less expensive water pumps to generate electricity compared to the standard current wind electric generators.Another object of the present invention is to have a hybrid wind turbine electricity generating system that converts the wind energy into kinetic water energy to directly drive a generator by means of a turbine thus avoiding the need for a gearbox.Another object of the present invention is to eliminate the use of a nacelle in certain embodiments of the present invention as an unnecessary addition to the tower because of the reduced number and size of the components and therefore the reduced need for protection and maintenance of these components.Another object of the present invention is to enable an easy and fast installation of the system, especially in remote locations, because of the smaller and fewer components.Another object of the present invention is to provide a system that has the capability of storing water as potential energy in a way that said water can be circulated and returned back into the system to produce electricity for the grid again.Another object of the present invention is to provide a system that will direct the internally, primary produced wind electricity to operate a water pump lifting low elevation water into high elevation water thus converting it into potential energy for producing secondary electricity ready for the grid or for private use.Another object of the present invention is to provide an option for a HAWT with a downwind orientation of the blade's assembly to engage reinforcements for protecting these blades from bending and braking.Another object of the invention is to build wind turbines with fewer and smaller components, which could be easily installed on remote locations without a need for big cranes.Yet another object of the invention, in general, is to manage the wind energy to suit the needs for electricity consumption.Further objects of the invention will appear as the description proceeds.To the accomplishment of the above and related objects, this invention may be embodied in the form illustrated in the accompanying drawings, attention being called to the fact, that the drawings are schematic only and that changes may be made in the specific construction illustrated and described within the scope of the appended claims.Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following descriptions, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of illustration and example, an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1Aschematically shows a hybrid electric generating system of the present invention utilizing a horizontal-axis wind turbine.FIG. 1Bis identical toFIG. 1Aexcept that the gearbox7is missing.FIGS. 1C & 1Dare examples of some embodiments of the hybrid electric generating system of the present invention without the nacelle.FIG. 1Eschematically illustrates the hybrid electric generating system of the present invention wherein the large lower water reservoir is positioned underground, under or near the main tower.FIG. 2Aschematically shows a hybrid electric generating system of the present invention utilizing a vertical-axis wind turbine.FIG. 2Bis identical toFIG. 2Aexcept that the gearbox7is missing.FIG. 3Aschematically shows a hybrid electric generating system of the present invention utilizing a horizontal-axis wind turbine with a direct rotor to pump mechanical connection for motion transfer utilizing a differential type gearbox wherein the two shafts of said gearbox form a 90 degree angle.FIG. 3Bschematically shows a hybrid electric generating system of the present invention utilizing a vertical-axis wind turbine with a direct rotor to pump mechanical connection and not utilizing any gearbox.

It is to be understood, however, that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner.The present invention is directed to wind turbine towers or tower systems configured for storing water in water containers within the tower structure itself and/or next to it and for generating electricity using the potential energy of the stored water. Briefly, the towers of modern, utility-scale wind turbine tower systems are typically metal or cement structures with a circular cross section that in addition to supporting a nacelle are adapted, according to the present invention, to store water. To achieve this functionality, the tower is modified by providing two or more water containers within the tower or near it and when necessary, reinforcing the tower structure with additional materials. Additionally, the invention builds on the proximity of water and electrical support equipment to the wind turbine to improve efficiencies by connecting this equipment to the wind turbine power converter. This arrangement avoids the losses and inefficiencies associated with many prior electricity generating designs that include multiple power conversions.One advantage of the present system is that the need for a pitch-control assembly might be eliminated. The pitch-control assembly is again an expensive and a heavy addition to the wind turbine rotor. The present invention preferably uses a fixed pitch wind turbine rotor. A fixed pitch wind turbine rotor offers a simplification at lower cost over that of a controllable blade pitch wind turbine rotor. A fixed pitch turbine rotor is designed to stall in high winds, to limit rotor's torque. Therefore, the generator must be capable of absorbing the maximum power output the rotor can generate. The rotor in turn must have the capability to not critically overspeed in the event the load is removed from it. The present invention does that by continuously circulating water. Thus, in a sense, the load need not be removed from it.An even more important advantage of the present invention is that it produces more power because any wind, weak or strong, may be harnessed. Wind blows at variable speed, sometimes gusting, while the electric generators powered by the wind turbine must rotate at a constant speed because the AC current generated must have a constant frequency. This requires that the blades of the wind turbine be automatically adjusted in order to rotate at a constant speed. This is done by the pitch-control assembly. But the pitch-control doesn't do all the job expected from it. With a conventional wind turbine, when the wind is weak, the turbine doesn't work because there is a minimum starting wind velocity needed. When the wind is too strong, at the maximum wind velocity, the turbine has to be stopped because it will bend or break the blades or it will turn the generator at higher rotations, which will disable it from delivering the required 50 to 60 Hz of AC power for the grid utility system.The preference for using a fixed pitch wind turbine rotor in the present invention is not only because it is cheaper but mainly because it can harness more wind energy. This type of rotor is turning faster during high winds as opposed to a rotor with pitch-controlled blades, which keeps on turning with the same speed in all conditions. This means that the pitch-controlled blades are missing much of the energy that could be harnessed during high winds. The energy of the wind doubles when the speed doubles. The fixed pitch rotor captures that energy which can double many times between low and high speeds. The present system then conserves that energy for later use.The pitch-control rotor misses on all of that action. It may keep on turning during high wind and it creates an illusion that it is working hard but it is actually capturing the same amount of energy because it is rotating with the same speed as if the wind speed was low. Most of the wing energy, which we don't see just by looking at it, is lost between the blades.The use of water containers as pressure vessels for storing energy results in a cost and energy savings when compared to the use of standard wind turbines. The incremental cost of modifying the tower to store water is significantly less than providing separate water pressure equipment (such as water dams). Energy is saved because the volume provided by a typical tower is so large that a large quantity of mass of water can be temporarily stored at lower expense for later use and could be continuously circulated.The following description begins with a discussion of a system for storing water within a wind turbine tower with reference toFIGS. 1A & 1B. The system also includes features for generating electricity using the stored water, and for distributing the produced electricity. The description then continues with reference to the rest of the FIGURES with more particular discussions of wind turbine tower systems configured according to the invention, showing various techniques for modifying towers for storage and for making use of the stored water. Finally, with reference toFIGS. 4A,7A & B and8A & B a method of designing, fabricating, and operating a wind turbine tower system with in-tower and in-building water storages and additional tower(s) with water storage reservoirs connected to the primary wind turbine is described in detail. At the end, in series ofFIG. 9, needed reinforcements of a fixed blade assembly are shown.With reference toFIG. 1Athe essential concept of the present invention and the means by which it is intended to operate may be appreciated.FIG. 1Ashows a wind turbine assembly comprising a vertically alignedtower1firmly attached to thebase2. On the top of thetower1there is the blades section, which comprises plurality ofturbine blades3, attached to ahub4. This assembly, the blades with the hub together, is called rotor. Said rotor, for the present invention, is preferably a fixed pitch rotor. There is thenacelle5housing thefirst shaft6, which transmits the low-speed, high-torque power from the blade'srotor hub4to the gearbox7. The gearbox7is basically a transmission which converts the power from saidfirst shaft6to thesecond shaft8, and transfers the now high-speed, low-torque rotation ofshaft8to the primary power generator9. The average speed of the lowspeed input shaft6may vary from 12 to 60 rpm but the required speed for an AC generator to produce electricity is between 1,200 to 3,600 rpm. Therefore the high-speed output shaft8turns with about this many rotations depending upon the wind conditions and the generator requirements.If the generator9is a DC generator then the above ratio could be different. A DC generator can produce electricity at any speed. For our purposes the DC generator is preferable but because there are already so many wind turbine systems on the market with an AC generator incorporated in them and ready for use, an AC generator is acceptable and could be adapted into the system of the present invention.If the whole system is built from scratch, then for economic purposes the generator9should be a DC generator. The reason is that a DC generator may produce electricity on both low and high-speed shaft rotation thus it can work with low and high winds. For the same reason it doesn't need a pitch-control and it can work with fixed pitch blades. This allows reducing the size of the gearbox7or even eliminating it entirely as shown inFIG. 1B.At10a yaw assembly is permitting a horizontal rotation of the nacelle for alignment with the wind. The yaw assembly is controlled by an electronic control box (not shown) which tells it which way and how much to turn. The control box gets its data from an anemometer and a wind vane (not shown). The anemometer measures the wind speed and the wind vane measures the wind direction.At11a lower water tank reservoir is shown. This reservoir may be inside the tower, next to the tower, around the tower or underground. At12an upper water tank reservoir is shown (because it is smaller we will call it a container). This container stores water as a potential energy. When wind is blowing the primary electric power generator9produces electricity which turns, via electric wires (not shown),electric motor13.Electric motor13is coaxially linked to pump14, which draws water fromreservoir11and throughconduit15delivers it to theupper water tank12. Said water then under pressure passes through the propeller ofwater turbine17via theconduit16with a nozzle at the lower end (not shown). The falling water then releases its potential energy into kinetic energy of the spinning turbine shaft. Theturbine17turns the auxiliary, coaxially connected to it, shaft of anAC generator18which then produces electricity for the grid or for private use. After utilizing its kinetic energy the water continues on moving and it is collected back into thelower reservoir11ready to be reused.In the present invention, because the blades might be fixedly attached to the hub, they could be set to start turning the turbine at a lower wind speed and then keep on turning it at high speeds without having to stop it. A very high wind speed will turn the rotor faster and in turn it will deliver more primary electricity for the internal use of the system, which will then turn faster thepump14and overflow theupper water container12. However, the overflow water will be returned unused and collected back into thelower reservoir11. At the same time pressure on theturbine17and the adjacentsecond generator18will remain constant, thus the same frequency of electricity will be produced at any time, regardless of the wind speed. The rotor doesn't have to stop rotating.Therefore, by utilizing the present invention, longer working hours will be achieved, compared to the conventional wind turbines. Also more remote or high locations for installation of such turbines could be reached because of the extended working land area of the present system. For example, some places are not windy enough for the contemporary wind turbines in use and others are too windy. Other places are located on a high altitude.With reference toFIGS. 1C & 1Din the drawings a vertical-axis wind turbine is shown, according to the present invention, the nacelle on top of the main tower is removed because of the smaller number and size of the components compared to a standard wind turbine. This may be applied to all embodiments of the invention.With reference toFIG. 1Ein the drawings a vertical-axis wind turbine is shown according to the present invention wherein themain reservoir11is positioned underground, under or nearby the wind tower. This may be applied to all of the embodiments of the invention.With reference toFIGS. 2A & 2Bin the drawings a vertical-axis wind turbine is shown, according to the present invention. Except for the blades and the vertical shaft, everything else in this embodiment is the same as inFIGS. 1A & 1B. The shaft of the rotor assembly in this embodiment is vertical and it is connected toshaft6of the gearbox7, (FIG. 2A) or directly connected toshaft8of the generator9(FIG. 2B). In this embodiment the gearbox7, (FIG. 2A) and the generator9are also positioned vertically inside the tower's body. In the embodiment ofFIG. 2Bthe gearbox7and is eliminated and there is no need for a yaw assembly.With reference toFIG. 3Ain the drawings a horizontal-axis wind turbine according to the present invention is shown. In this embodiment everything is the same as inFIG. 1Aexcept that the gearbox7and the generator9on the top of thetower assembly1are missing andmotor13and water pump14connected to thelower reservoir11are missing. Instead,shaft6from the blade assembly transfers its horizontal rotation into vertical rotation ofshaft20via adifferential type gearbox21. In this type of gearbox the twoshafts6and20form a 90 degree angle.Shaft20passes through the middle of theyaw assembly10. Saidshaft20then transmits its rotation directly to thewater pump22. Thewater pump22is connected via theconduit15such as a pipe or a hose to thelower reservoir11. When the wind is blowing the rotation of the blade assembly is directly, mechanically transmitted to thepump22which then pumps water from thelower reservoir11via saidconduit15and delivers it into theupper container12. All other operations of this embodiment are the same as described for the embodiment ofFIG. 1A.InFIG. 3Ban embodiment of a vertical-axis wind turbine is shown, according to the invention. In this embodiment everything is the same as inFIG. 3Aexcept that the blades are vertical and the rotor is vertical. Thedifferential type gearbox21and theyaw assembly10have been eliminated because there is no need for them. The turbine has avertical axis6, which is linked toshaft20. Saidshaft20directly turns thewater pump22. The rest of the operation of this embodiment is the same as for theFIG. 3A.With reference toFIG. 4in the drawings a different concept of a wind turbine is presented. Herein, next to the basic concept of previous FIGS., there is awater storage tower23with an elevatedlarge water reservoir24and afoundation25. The volume ofreservoir24is many times the volume ofcontainer12but smaller thenreservoir11.Reservoir24stores water as potential energy for times when there is low wind or no wind.The embodiment inFIG. 4works as follows: When the wind is blowing and the turbine's rotor is turning an electrical transmission line delivers electricity from the generator9tomotor13. Said motor turns thewater pump14, which pumps water from thelower reservoir11and viaconduit15and15adeposits it into thecontainer12. When water reaches its maximum predetermined level incontainer12it lifts the floatingball28a, or similar means, and closes theend valve28ofconduit15a. Water then continues via conduit15bup intoreservoir24. Thevalve28constantly opens and closes because the water level in saidcontainer12constantly rises and drops since said water is used to run the hydro-turbine17after which it is discharged back intoreservoir11for reuse. When the water level drops, thevalve28opens and more water enters inside thecontainer12, which again rises the water level and closes the valve.When the wind isstrong pump14gets sufficient power to pump water fromcontainer11which is enough to fill thecontainer12up to the level which closesvalve28. This means that no more water enterscontainer12and water continues up conduit15bto reach thereservoir24for storage and for later use.When the water level incontainer12is low again, water fromreservoir24leaves said reservoir and viaconduit26is delivered back intocontainer12. The level of the opening26aon the bottom ofreservoir24, where water entersconduit26, is always higher then the permitted predetermined maximum water level incontainer12. There is a funnel-shapedvalve attachment27at the other end whereconduit26enterscontainer12. There is a floatingball27a(FIGS. 5A & 5B) or a flowing funnel-shapeddevice27b(FIGS. 6A & 6B) inside saidvalve attachment27for closing said valve in order to prevent water fromconduit26to flow into said container when necessary.When water is drained fromreservoir24intocontainer12and water level in said container rises, the water lifts the floatingball27a, or the funnel-shapeddevice27b, which then closes thevalve27and no more water can enter into saidcontainer12. This keeps automatically the amount of water inside said container at the same level, which means that the pressure on the hydro-turbine17is always the same. Saidvalve27constantly opens and closes in order to keep the water level quite even. Thus said hydro-turbine17revolves with the same speed and always delivers an even AC current through theelectric generator18for the grid network no mater what the water pressure inreservoir24is.At a time when there is no wind and the rotor assembly of the wind turbine rotor is not turning, theAC generator18will still delivers electric power for the utility grid untilreservoir24is empty.On the other hand, when at night the demand for electric power is low but there is wind, the connection to the utility power grid could be shut down. This means that hydro-turbine17will stop revolving, no water will be passing downconduit16andcontainer12will quickly fill up. This will first closevalve27and thenvalve28, which is positioned higher thenvalve27. Closing thevalve28will prevent water from draining fromreservoir24intocontainer12. Because of the available wind, the blade assembly of therotor4will keep on turning. Thepump14then will keep on pumping water fromreservoir11viaconduits15, which is split into15aand15b. Butvalve27already closed15atherefore water will continue via15bonly up towards thelarge water reservoir24for storage. Thus the system will be accumulating water as potential energy for later use.If the wind is too strong, the water may overflow thelarge reservoir24. In that case the excess water will be returned unused via theoverflow conduit29back to theprimary reservoir11.InFIGS. 5A&Band6A&B the funnel-shaped valve27(28is the same) and the floatingball27aor the floating funnel-shapeddevice27binside are shown up and down. When the water level is high it lifts them up and they close the valves. When the water level is low, they drop down and open the valves. They are prevented from escaping from the valves by the grid attachment27cat the bottom of the valves. Said grid attachment27chowever allows the water to freely enter and leave said valves.InFIG. 7Athe wind turbine is the same as inFIG. 3A. The only difference is thatwater pump22is now positioned low, inside or nearreservoir11andshaft20is extended downwards to directly connect with said pump. The advantage of this arrangement is that when saidpump22is down, it does not transfer its vibrations directly to the tower. The disadvantage is thatshaft20is too long.FIG. 7Bfeatures a vertical-axis wind turbine. Everything else is the same as inFIG. 7A.FIGS. 8A & 8Bshow abuilding28utilizing the system of the present invention. InFIG. 8Asaidbuilding28is transparent and we can see the system of the present invention installed inside. Specifically the embodiment ofFIG. 7Bof a vertical-axis wind turbine is presented but any of the embodiments of the present invention could be utilized. On the top of the building there is a vertical-axis propeller withblades3, thehub4and theshaft20. All of them form the rotor which via saidshaft20transfers its rotation, when there is wind, to thepump22. Said pump lifts water from thelower reservoir11into theupper container12. Said water then runs downconduit16and by turning the hydro-turbine17and thegenerator18produces electricity for the consumption of the building. If there is an excess of electricity it might be delivered back to the utility grid. Thus buildings with such systems could become partially or fully self sufficient in their own electric power consumption and can even produce electricity for outside use.On the middle or above the middle floors of the building, instead ofcontainer12, one or more floors could be used as water containers. Presently some tall buildings use one or more middle floors as water containers for a better stability in case of an earthquake. It has been tested that in case of an earthquake middle floors accommodating such water tanks absorb the vibrations of the quake and the buildings emerge stronger afterwards. In the present invention water inside the middle or top floors may serve both purposes. At the same time such floors with water container could be connected to water sprinklers and could be useful in case of fire.With reference toFIG. 9Aa combined hybrid water pressure energy accumulating tower assembly adjacent and connected to a wind turbine or to a wind power plant is shown. Everything here works as described forFIG. 1Aexcept that on the top of the tower the wind turbine rotor and nacelle is removed and the present tower assembly gets its primary electricity from the adjacent wind turbine(s) in order to accumulate energy by lifting water from the lower water reservoir to the upper water container. The advantage of the present invention is that such tower might be positioned next or close to already existing wind turbines.FIG. 9Bschematically shows the combined hybrid water pressure energy accumulating tower assembly with additional large water reservoir on the top of the tower assembly which is connected to the middle and the bottom water reservoirs.FIG. 9Cschematically shows the hybrid tower assembly with a large reservoir on top, supported by and connected to four wind turbines for better stability.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR INCREASING ENERGYCAPTURE IN A WIND TURBINEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed generally to wind turbines, and more particularly to a method for increasing energy capture. In particular, the present invention is directed to controlling the speed of rotation of the wind turbine blades to increase the amount of energy capture.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONRecently, wind turbines have received increased attention as environmentally safe and relatively inexpensive alternative energy sources.With this growing interest, considerable efforts have been made to develop wind turbines that are reliable and efficient.Generally, a wind turbine includes a rotor having multiple blades. The rotor is mounted to a housing or nacelle, which is positioned on top of a truss or tubular tower. Utility grade wind turbines (i.e., wind turbines designed to provide electrical power to a utility grid) can have large rotors (e.g., 30 or more meters in length). In addition, the wind turbines are typically mounted on towers that are at least 60 meters in height. Blades on these rotors transform wind energy into a rotational torque or force that drives one or more generators that may be rotationally coupled to the rotor through a gearbox. The gearbox steps up the inherently low rotational speed of the turbine rotor for the generator to efficiently convert mechanical energy to electrical energy, which is fed into a utility grid.During normal operation, wind turbines with sophisticated control system maintain constant speed and power by active blade pitch control. The initial design of a wind turbine controls may use standards such as IEC 61400. In the control configuration, the standardized environmental conditions such as average wind speed, turbulence intensity or air density are the basis for the design. The IECstandard defines a small number of different \"type classes\" that categorize a wind turbine design for broader range of environmental conditions. As such, the standard controller configuration fails to address all of the types of site locations on which the wind turbine may be installed.For example, many wind turbine sites include more favorable environmental conditions that give less stress on the actual wind turbine than the design conditions. At these sites, it is possible to use this application to increase the wind turbine performance, using a higher average rotor speed, without damaging wind turbine components.Therefore, what is needed is a method for operating a wind turbine that permits increased energy capture by controlling the rotor speed in response to measured or calculated operational parameters.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONOne aspect of the present invention includes a method for operating a wind turbine. The method includes providing a wind turbine having a variable speed control system, the control system having an initial rotational speed set point. At least two operational parameters are obtained from one or more sensors. An adjusted rotational speed set point greater than the initial rotational speed set point is determined in response to the operational parameter.

The wind turbine 100 includes a nacelle 102 mounted atop a tall tower 104, only a portion of which is shown in FIG. 1. Wind turbine 100 also comprises a wind turbine rotor 106 that includes one or more rotor blades attached to a rotating hub 110. Although wind turbine 100 illustrated in FIG.includes three rotor blades 108, there are no specific limits on the number of rotor blades 108 required by the present invention. The height of tower 104 is selected based upon factors and conditions known in the art.In some configurations and referring to FIG. 2, various components are housed in nacelle 102 atop tower 104. One or more microcontrollers or other control components (not shown) are housed within control panel 112. The microcontrollers include hardware and software configured to provide a control system providing overall system monitoring and control, including pitch and speed regulation, high-speed shaft and yaw brake application, yaw and pump motor application and fault monitoring. In alternative embodiments of the disclosure, the control system may be a distributed control architecture not solely provided for by the control panel 112 as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. The control system provides control signals to a variable blade pitch drive 114 to control the pitch of blades 108 (FIG. 1) that drive hub 110 as a result of wind. In some configurations, the pitches of blades 108 are individually controlled by blade pitch drive 114.The drive train of the wind turbine includes a main rotor shaft 116 (also referred to as a \"low speed shaft\") connected to hub 110 and supported by a main bearing 130 and, at an opposite end of shaft 116, to a gear box 118. Gear box 118, in some configurations, utilizes a dual path geometry to drive an enclosed high-speed shaft. The high-speed shaft (not shown in FIG. 2) is used to drive generator 120, which is mounted on mainframe 132. In some configurations, rotor torque is transmitted via coupling 122. Generator 120 may be of any suitable type, for example, a wound rotor induction generator.Yaw drive 124 and yaw deck 126 provide a yaw orientation system for wind turbine 100. Anemometry provides information for the yaw orientation system, including measured instantaneous wind direction and wind speed at the wind turbine.Anemometry may be provided by a wind vane 128. In some configurations, the yaw system is mounted on a flange provided atop tower 104. The present disclosure is not limited to the configuration shown in FIGs. 1 and 2 and may include any configuration of wind turbine 100 known in the art having a control system and rotational speed control. For example, the wind turbine 100 may include more or less than three blades 108.In some configurations and referring to FIG. 3, an exemplary control system 300 for wind turbine 100 includes a bus 302 or other communications device to communicate information. Processor(s) 304 are coupled to bus 302 to process information, including information from sensors configured to measure displacements or moments. Control system 300 further includes random access memory (RAM) 306 and/or other storage device(s) 308. RAM 306 and storage device(s) 308 are coupled to bus 302 to store and transfer information and instructions to be executed by processor(s) 305. RAM 306 (and also storage device(s) 308, if required) can also be used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor(s) 305. Control system 300 can also include read only memory (ROM) and or other static storage device 310, which is coupled to bus 302 to store and provide static (i.e., non-changing) information and instructions to processor(s) 304. Input/output device(s) 312 can include any device known in the art to provide input data to control system 300 and to provide yaw control and pitch control outputs. Instructions are provided to memory from a storage device, such as magnetic disk, a read-only memory (ROM) integrated circuit, CD-ROM, DVD, via a remote connection that is either wired or wireless providing access to one or more electronically-accessible media, etc. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry can be used in place of or in combination with software instructions. Thus, execution of sequences of instructions is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software instructions. Sensor interface 314 is an interface that allows control system 300 to communicate with one or more sensors. Sensor interface can be or can comprise, for example, one or more analog-to-digital converters that convert analog signals into digital signals that can be used by processor(s) 304. In one embodiment, the sensor interface includes signals from a rotor speed determining device and anemometry from wind vane 128.The present disclosure includes a method for increasing energy capture of a wind turbine by controllably adjusting the maximum or rated rotational speed set point in response to a measured operational value. \"Rotational speed\", as utilized herein, is defined as the speed at which the blades rotate about the hub. The rotational speed may include the speed at which the low speed shaft 116 rotates or may be calculated from the speed of the high-speed shaft or at the generator 120.\"Rated power\", as utilized herein, is defined as the power that the wind turbine generates at a maximum capacity, wherein the maximum capacity is determined by the control system. \"Rated rotational speed\", as utilized herein, is defined as the speed at which the rotor is permitted to rotate in continuous operations during full load operations.The rated rotational speed may correspond to the maximum power capacity, but may include wind turbine operation below the maximum power capacity.In one embodiment, the controlled adjustment may include a feature installed on an existing wind turbine with no modification of the wind turbine components. During the period of time of increased maximum rotor speed set point, the wind turbine is able to run at a higher rated power and achieve a significantly higher energy production. In this embodiment, no components of the turbine need to be changed or added.The method includes operating a wind turbine having a variable speed control system. As discussed above, wind turbine control systems typically include sophisticated control systems and control programs. The control programs utilize wind turbine components to adjust various operational parameters within the wind turbine 100. For example, pitch blade angle and generator torque may be adjusted to vary the power output at the generator 120 and/or to adjust the rotational speed of the blades 108 in response to a wind speed. Typically, the wind turbine 100 will include a variable speed operational period (e.g., operation during shutdown and startup) and a constant speed operational period (e.g., during normal operating conditions or at maximum rated power operation). For the constant speed operational period, the control system includes an initial or rated rotational speed set point value.The initial rotational speed set point value corresponds to the designed maximum rotational speed at which the wind turbine is permitted to operate. While not so limited, the initial rotational speed set point value may be determined according to known design parameters or standards, such as international standards (e.g., IEC 61400). In the control configuration, the standardized environmental conditions such as average wind speed, turbulence intensity or air density for a theoretical average wind turbine site may form the basis for the design and configuration. While during normal operation (i.e., the constant speed operational period), the rotational speed is not permitted to exceed the maximum rotational speed set point. It is noted, however, that power output of the wind turbine 100 may vary at the maximum rotational speed by varying other parameters, such as torque. The method of the present disclosure includes a method wherein the initial rated rotational speed set point value is increased from the initial value in response to at least two operational parameters.The operational parameters are measured at one or mores sensors at the wind turbine 100, at a monitoring station for a wind turbine plant, or at a location corresponding to the wind turbine operation.The operational parameter are preferably selected from the group consisting of generator speed, power output, turbulence intensity (e.g., turbulence intensity measured as function of the standard deviation of the rotational speed), wind speed, wind direction (both in vertical and horizontal sense), wind shear, the combination of ambient temperature and air pressure, air density, component temperatures (e.g., generator windings, bearings, generator and gearbox cooling, gearbox oil, transformer, and/or converter), generator torque, current in generator rotor and stator, voltage in generator rotor and stator, power factor, tower top vibration, drive train vibrations, yaw position and combinations thereof. More preferably, the operational parameter is at least two parameters selected from the group consisting of an air turbulence intensity, air density, tower vibration, ambient temperature, wind turbine component temperature, yaw position and combinations thereof.The sensors for measuring the operational parameters may be any suitable sensors known in the art for measuring or sensing the operational parameter.Suitable sensors may include thermometers, thermocouples, thermisters, anemometers, pressure sensors, optical sensors, proximity sensors, encoders (e.g., encoder mounted on the individual components) or any other known sensor or sensor system. The sensors may be included at the wind turbine location or at a location remote from the wind turbine, such as at a remote monitoring system. In addition, the sensor may indirectly measure an operational parameter, such as by measuring a value that may be utilized to calculate an operational parameter. In addition, a plurality of sensors may be utilized to determine a single operational parameter.Once the operational parameters are obtained, an adjusted, increased, rotational speed set point value is determined in response to the operational parameter.The amount of increase in rotational speed can be determined using any suitable model or calculation that is capable of determining a rotor speed that is greater than the initial rotational speed set point, and provides an adjusted rotor speed that is mechanically permitted by the wind turbine 100 and the conditions surrounding the wind turbine 100. In one embodiment, the target rotational speed is a function of the standard deviation of the controlled rotational speed, which may be a measure of turbulence intensity. In addition, the increase in rotational speed set point value may be determined by the general relationship that as the annual average wind speed decreases, the mechanical loads on the wind turbine decrease, permitting an increase in rotational speed set point value. In addition, as the turbulence intensity decreases, the mechanical loads on the wind turbine decrease, permitting an increase in rotational speed set point value. Further, as the air density decreases, the mechanical loads on the wind turbine decrease, permitting an increase in rotational speed set point value.Likewise, as the ambient air temperature surrounding the wind turbine decreases significantly, the air density increases, permitting an increase in rotational speed set point value (this increase in set point would be lower than the case with higher density but higher than standard conditions). The above relationships are merely exemplary and are not exhaustive.Combinations of two or more operational parameters are preferably utilized according to their respect relationships. For example, a lower ambient temperature and a higher air density are favorable for the cooling of the components, which results in lower mechanical loads on the wind turbine 100, permitting an increase in rotational speed set point value. A reduced power factor increases the electrical current and with that, the temperatures of components within the wind turbine 100, permitting an increase in rotational speed set point value. Also, with higher rotational speed, the temperature of some components of the wind turbine increases and other unfavorable component properties like voltage of the generator can increase. The new set point for the generator may be set, based on the parameters described above. For example, using the physical relationship of these parameters on turbine loads and power determines the new set point. For example, a measured standard density of 1.225 with medium turbulence, may result in a speed set point 6 %greater than the initial rotational speed set point. In addition, if the measured density is 1.100 (i.e., lower than 1.225) adjust rotational speed set point will be set to 9%above the initial rotational speed set point.Generally, the inverse relationships of the above operational parameters to the value of increased rotational speed set point result in a reduction in the amount of increase or prevents an increase in the rotational speed set point value. For example, during high wind events, high component temperatures or adverse meteorological conditions, the control system may only slightly increase the rotational speed set point value, or may not increase the rotational speed set point value.FIG. 4 shows a process flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, first, a determination is made to whether controller speed control adjustment is activated, step 401. If the controller speed is not activated the controller maintains default settings, step 403. The default settings include a setting of the speed control to the initial rotational speed set point value.The determination in step 401 may include a switch, button, software determined option, or other mechanism that permits the selective activation of the speed control adjustment method. If the speed control adjustment is activated, at least two operational parameters are obtained, step 405. The operational parameters are preferably obtained from sensors. Once the operational parameters are obtained, an adjusted rotational speed is determined in response to the operational parameters, step 407. The adjusted rotational speed is an adjusted rotational speed set point value for the control system that is greater than the initial or rated rotational speed set point value. The controller or control system is configured with the adjusted rotational speed set point, step 409. The control system permits the wind turbine to operate at the increased rotational speed set point value and the method repeats.In one embodiment, a user interface is provided to provide the speed control activation, step 401. In this embodiment the interface, may include, but is not limited to, the following: 1) an option to set time of day to operate in boost, 2) an option to set maximum boost allowed - up to a (e.g., extreme loads defined) limit, 3) an option to control the wind turbine remotely from a central control with plant power limits and plant power factors incorporated in the control provided by the central control. The interface is not so limited and may include other options or other features, as desired for wind turbine and wind turbine plant operation.In one embodiment, the ability for the controller to adjust the rotational set point value can be activated by an external requirement. Suitable external requirements that may activate the ability for the controller to adjust the maximum rotor speed include, but are not limited to, electrical (e.g., power factor or overall rating) or environmental site properties (e.g., wind speed, wind shear, turbulence). In one embodiment, an estimate of the lifetime or change in the lifetime of the turbine, e.g. calculated out of simulations of mechanical fatigue loads, based upon increased maximum rotor speeds may be communicated to a user, central monitoring station or other location. In addition, the external requirement may include electrical or site properties over the entire wind plant. For example, a wind plant comprising a plurality of wind turbines may include an external requirement of a maximum plant power output (i.e., the total power produced by the entire wind plant), which when exceeded selectively prevents wind turbines from increasing the rotational speed set point value in excess of the initial or rated rotational speed set point value.FIG. 5 shows a process flow diagram illustrating another embodiment of the present disclosure. The embodiment shown in FIG. 5 includes obtaining an external requirement, step 501. In this embodiment, first, a determination is made to whether the external requirement is satisfied, step 503. If the external requirement is not satisfied, the process is repeated and the rotational speed set point value is maintained at the initial rotational speed set point value. If the external requirement is satisfied, at least two operational parameters are obtained, step 405. The operational parameters are preferably obtained from sensors. Once the operational parameters are obtained, an adjusted rotational speed is determined in response to the operational parameters, step 407. The adjusted rotational speed is an adjusted rotational speed set point value for the control system that is greater than the initial or rated rotational speed set point value. The controller or control system is configured with the adjusted rotational speed set point, step 409. The control system permits the wind turbine to operate at the increased rotational speed set point value and the method repeats.EXAMPLEExample 1 includes results of simulations using the method of the present disclosure for annual energy production (AEP) in terms of percent increase for operation at rotational speed set points greater than the initial speed set point for varying wind speed averages (Va~g), see Table 1.
