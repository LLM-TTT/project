    "The Biometric Vehicle Access System (BVAS) is an innovative technology designed to revolutionize traditional vehicle security and access methods.\n",
    "This system emplopatent_abstractys advanced biometric authentication, including fingerprint and facial recognition, to ensure secure and convenient entry and ignition processes.\n",
    "BVAS enhances vehicle security by replacing traditional key-based and electronic fob systems with a seamless and personalized biometric verification process. The technology integrates biometric sensors into door handles, steering wheels, and ignition systems, allowing for quick and reliable user authentication. The BVAS not only provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access but also enhances user convenience by eliminating the need for physical keys or key fobs. Users can effortlessly unlock, start, and operate their vehicles through a simple and rapid biometric scan. The system is designed with robust anti-spoofing measures to prevent unauthorized access attempts.\n",
    "Furthermore, BVAS contributes to the growing trend of biometric integration in smart vehicles, aligning with the industry's commitment to innovation, user experience, and safety. As vehicles continue to evolve into interconnected and autonomous entities, BVAS sets a new standard for personalized and secure access, catering to the increasing demand for sophisticated yet user-friendly solutions in the automotive sector.\n",

The technology integrates biometric sensors into door handles, steering wheels, and ignition systems, allowing for quick and reliable user authentication. The BVAS not only provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access but also enhances user convenience by eliminating the need for physical keys or key fobs. Users can effortlessly unlock, start, and operate their vehicles through a simple and rapid biometric scan. The system is designed with robust anti-spoofing measures to prevent unauthorized access attempts.\\nFurthermore, BVAS contributes to the growing trend of biometric integration in smart vehicles, aligning with the industry\\'s commitment to innovation, user experience, and safety. As vehicles continue to evolve into interconnected and autonomous entities, BVAS sets a new standard for personalized and secure access, catering to the increasing demand for sophisticated yet user-friendly solutions in the automotive sector.\\n\"\\n        US20100299002A1: \"A system for authenticating individuals traveling to and from various destinations at various times. Personal identity and travel privilege verification are coordinated for several modes of transportation, including aircraft, boats, buses, cars and trains. Travel privileges are considered to be the ability to leave the current location, travel to the desired location, travel at specific times, and use specific forms of transportation. The system specifically provides operator privilege verification, allowing individuals to receive vehicle operator privileges. These privileges are evaluated upon the individual\\'s application, and are periodically updated at the discretion of the controlling institution.\"\\nUS20180201225A1: \"A method for authorizing a driver to activate at least one system of a vehicle, includes a preliminary phase that includes an initialization step, an enrollment step scanning enrollment biometric data of the driver, an access step for the driver to enter the vehicle, and a storage step registering enrollment biometric data in memory. The method also includes a subsequent phase that includes an authentication step scanning authentication biometric data of the driver and comparing said authentication biometric data with the enrollment biometric data in the memory, then an activation step wherein, if the authentication biometric data match with the enrollment biometric data, in authorizing the driver to activate the at least one system of the vehicle, or a refusal step wherein, if the authentication biometric data does not match with the enrollment biometric data, in forbidding the driver to activate the at least one system of the vehicle.\"\\nUS8952781B2: \"A biometrically authenticated access control in which a wireless authentication signal is provided from a primary instrumentality of access, only after a dual-stage biometric verification of the user\\'s identity is performed. In one embodiment, an accessing device includes memory for storing a device identification code and an authentication code, along with first and second biometric templates corresponding to biometric samples from a user. In another embodiment, an accessing device includes memory for storing a device identification code and more than one authentication code, for separate users, along with first and second biometric templates corresponding to biometric samples from multiple users. In order to gain access to a secured resource, a user undergoes first and second biometric sampling to generate biometric data to be compared with the first and second biometric templates.\"\\nCN111231893B: \"The invention relates to a method (17) for operating a shared vehicle (1) and to a corresponding shared vehicle (1). The invention provides that the biometric data of the holder of the driver\\'s license (14) is read from the driver\\'s license (14) carried by the user (5) by means of a data acquisition device (13). Furthermore, at least one biometric of the user (5) is detected by means of the identification device (13) during the stay of the user in the area of the shared vehicle (1). Next, to verify the read data, the data is compared with the detected biometric features. In the event of agreement between the read data and the detected biometric feature, i.e. when a positive test result is obtained, the shared vehicle (1) is activated for the user (5) for use.\"\\nUS8694793B2: \"Aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure provide devices and methods for biometric authentication of a user during access control transactions. In one aspect, an access control processor device, comprising a biometric input sensor configured to receive user biometric information; a biometric verification processor configured to authenticate the input user biometric information; and a communication element configured to activate when the biometric information entered into the biometric verification system is authenticated and maintain an inactive status for the communication element on the payment processor device when the biometric information entered into the biometric verification system is not authenticated.\"\\nEP1705085B1: \"A driver authenticating apparatus has a camera for capturing a facial image of a person in a driver seat, and a controller connected to the camera. The controller permits a driver to start an vehicle engine if the captured facial image matches a pre-registered facial image of an authorized driver.

A network-based biometric authentication platform stores biometric templates for individuals which have been securely enrolled with the authentication platform. A plurality of sensor platforms separately establishes secure communications with the biometric authentication platform. The sensor platform can perform a biometric scan of an individual and generate a biometric authentication template. The sensor platform then requests biometric authentication of the individual by the biometric authentication platform via the established secure communications. The biometric authentication platform compares the generated biometric template to one or more of the enrolled biometric templates stored in memory at the biometric authentication platform. The result of the authentication is then communicated to the requesting sensor platform via the established secure communications.\"\\nUS11397800B2: \"A removable card-enabled BPID Security Device integrates a removable card reader with a biometric authentication component to provide secured access to electronic systems. The device allows for an individual to insert a removable card into an aperture in the physical enclosure of the BPID Security Device, allowing the removable card and the BPID Security Device to electronically communicate with each other. The BPID Security Device is based on a custom application specific integrated circuit that incorporates removable card terminals, such that the BPID Security Device can communicate directly with an inserted removable card. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the BPID Security Device is based on a commercial off-the-shelf microprocessor, and may communicate with a commercial off-the-shelf microprocessor removable card receiver using a serial, USB, or other type of communication protocol.
